# waipake
The waipake repository contains a database of digitised korero (stories) of extreme weather and earthquake impacts in Aotearoa New Zealand which impacted indigenous cultural infrastructures. It accompanies a raft of other work in the space, and is designed to assist Māori researchers in their disaster risk mahi.
