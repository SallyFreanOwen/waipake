gun the results attained are chifly due to bhe mechanism by which the used-up cartridge are automatically thrown out the weight of a 10-chambered carbine when loaded is only two kilogrammes in the

edison latest idea on wh ch he is now engaged in making experiments is the reproduction of theatrical performances without tbe instrumentality of manager or actor the great inventor idea is so to improve fhe phonograph and the kinetoscope that they will reproduce with absolute fidelity in the case of the former the chief difficulty was in overcoming the metallic character of the tone of the phonograph and the change of its timbre to that of the human voice so that all the modulations of the singers and actors could be exactly reproduced and the synchronisation of the phonograph with the kinetoscope reproduction for this reproduction the stage is entirely cleared and in the place of the scenery a white sheet is stretched from the flies to the stage behind the curtain a number of phonograph cipible oe multiplying sound 100 times and corresponding with tha number of actors in the cast is placed each of these phonographs contains the part of one of tbe characters in the gallery concealed from the audience is the kinteoscope containing some 300000 to 400000 photographs which will be thrown on the sheet at the rate of 48 der second so that the appsar to be continually moving without anyintsrruption both the phouograybf and the kinetoscope are to be worked by electricity connected on the same circuit so that the suiting of the scfciou to the word and the word t the nctiou

said he had never studied medicine any more than for the treatment of cancer he himself having been cured of cancer in a somewhat similar way dr svmes after hearing hullett statement of his treatment was of opinion that the treatment with the lotion used hastened death there was no doubt the man must have eventually died of the disease but he might have lived a great deal longer if he had not been

weather had been stormy all night heavy wind and rain making the prospect of the trip anything but enjoyable the party consisted of nineteen among them being three ladies the oil launch ongarue m whicii the trip was made is about sixty feet long with a centre deck covered by awning soon after starting driftwood damaged the vessel propeller wliich had to be replaced on reaching the tarepou rapid captain allen decided that he dare not risk the passage the party were compelled to camp aboard the little craft all night and until well on m the next day before the river fell sufficiently to allow resumption of the journey provisions were short and the boat being small the position was very uncomfortable captain allen decided about one oclock to attempt the passage and as the water had fallen the passengers were put ashore and told to crawl over the rocks to a point indicated where tliey would be taken on board again tliis walk over the slippery rocks was not altogether a pleasant sensation but with the prospect of getting out before them nodody grumbled after great difficulty the vessel managed to get through the rapids it taking half an hour to go only a few yards near the end of the rapids is a high bluff and here the rushing water had formed a dangerous whirlpool which as it filled with driftwood and pumice threatened the safety of the steamer on the edge of the whirlpool the passengers were taken on board but here another danger occurred the vessel started slowly forward creeping onward inch by inch to the big bluff when a peculiar whirl was heard and she drifted back the propellor having broken after considerable delay during whicii another propellor was rigged she commenced to move forward slowly again but after a few feet had been travelled the driftwood and pumice fouled the propellor again and the now well-known sound was heard and once more it was known that the propellor was damaged captain allen and ids crew at once started about repairing this damage the rocks being used for an anvil and after a short delay another move forward was made just as she turned jhe bluff the propellor jammed and again a blade had gone for a moment

"west coast times fr id ay august 6 1897 gods of clay the intelligenc9 that the hon j o ward has been re-elected a member of the house for the awarua seat will not occasion any surprise to those who have been watching the coarse of events mr ward vacated his seat because he was a bankrupt the statuce making it incumbent on every member of parliament to retire if he becomes a bankrupt the ofrvious intenfciou of the legislature is to make bankruptcy a bar to a seat in parliament there seems to be no express statutory provision that a man who is a bankrupt shall not gain a seat and consequently mr ward having resigned on his bankruptcy seeks re-election and is returned by aj enormous majority it is contended by those who support his action that the intention of the legislature was to compel a man who lutd been forced into he bankruptcy court to receive a moral whitewashing at the hands of the electors the financial whitewashing being left to the judge of the court that such an interpretation of the intention of the legislature is incorrect we have no doubt but this straining of the act is not to be wondered at from those who support the ministry of which mr ward was until recently such a conspicuous nieaaber of the nature of his bankruptcy it does not 1 become us at present to speak the pronouncement of the judge being yet to come but it is somewhat significant that so far we have had no intimation of his i intention to apply for an order lof discharge that mr ward should have been returned by an enormous majority is not a surprise the main features of his

claims of this gentleman upon the people of southland but it is very clear that he is not a persona grata when compared with the ex-treasurer the one redeeming feature ia this election is the conviction that gratitudewhether defined as a lively sense of past favors or of favors to cbme is a vital principle in the breasts of the southland farmers whatever his faults they derived the benefit the scores of thousands of pbunds which the unfortunate sharehblders of the colonial sink have seen so rudely dissipated have gone chiefly into the pockets of the southland farmer and they are

the station affairs became desperate with the assistance of a friend however he was released but at what a sacrifice he had to leave most of his pants stuck on the platform here was a fix and there

premier having made every attempt to conciliate the natives by meeting them m their own kaingas and discussing their grievances and their plans for the future it furthermore professed to have authority for believing that henare kaikau would support the government it is by no means certain that the government can rely upon henarea support if a recent conversation between mr hone heke mhr and his newly-fledged brother member is any criterion mr heke who was m wellington last week informed a representative of this journal that while he was m auckland mr kaikau called upon him and stated that he had come upon a special mission to see mr heke and discuss with him matters relating to the recent election it was his people desire that he i should sit upon the same side of the house as mr heke subsequently mr heke was waited upon by a deputation of waikato natives who gave a similar intimation as to their desire m the matter we are assured by mr heke that the waikato natives are not by any means so enraptured with the government polioy as the ministerial journals would have the public believe mr heke is to address a large meeting of waikato natives at an early date the sa tekapo

competitive shooting purposes owing to the bad and irregular quality of the powder the shooting contests instead of being a test of skill and marksmanship as they ought to be are bimply determined by chance sometimes a good packet of cartridges and sometimes a bad one one cartridge may be pretty iair and the next bad this is not what it ought to be and it is understood that the fault does not lie with the small arms ammunition company but with the government for providing rubbishy powder the census returns show that m every 100 persons 8060 could read and write 289 could read only and 1651

settlement purposes this being the case this among other properties has been open for months without a single offer the statement that the board has been offered 10 an acre for it is a pure

evading the land tax has been successfully resorted to in fact the premier stated when speaking on the land and income tax assessment bill that the law at present is ineffective to deal with the serious leakage of revenue caused by these tricks one illustration of how half the legal burden can be avoided was given by the premier a firm land is assess separately and to is the separate estate of each partner consequently if a owns land worth 100000 he would be rendered liable to a tax at the rate of 20 per centy which not cobntirig the 25 per cent increase proposed would airiount to 1000 but if v he gives his son b r nominal half-share in the estate as a partner then a is taxed on 50000 at the rate of ten shillings and a anq b are jointly taxed on the other 50000 at the sanie rate and so the total tax paid is only 500 there is nothing at present to prevent a landowner establishing a private company of which he practically owns all the shares arid transferring half his land to the company thus saving half the graduated tax in the same manner as a landed proprietor who had a son to shoulder half the responsibility the new bill as explained by the premier in his speech will

hatu and is supposed to have some five hundred or six hundred followers camping with him but rua religious views appear to tincture everything although he has a number of advanced ideas that no doubt would be calculated to benefilj the maoris they are counteracted to a considerable extent by other views and notions where he has ncmsy camped he has made a new village in the bush and maoris are all living there undeij canvas he has all the families living separately and wilt not permit any over-i crowding and the food is all rationed out to the natives who are compelled to live under good hygienic conditions bi buck seems to think that rua influence over the maoris if not at a standstill is and is likely to decrease for all these people are working hard and there is nothing very

wliich people with normal hearts imd dropped dead by suddenly forcing the heart to do extraordinary work he believed that most of the cases of sudden death were due to self ill-treatment too much work either at business or play and too little naturalness of hying he knew of cases in which infants possessed diseased hearts but who had grown to early manhood before being seriously inconvenienced tlie constant drinking of stimulants might be a contributing cause to tlie over-taxing of the heart and death of a patient the doctor also condemned inordinate smoking as being extremely injurious he believed that many men owed the loss of tlieir lives to tobacco and said that where persons wilfully aggravated the organ by unnatural habits the symptoms were olten distressing but would frequently cease with the abandonment of the habits he was also ofopinion that the great majority of people i who believed that they had lieart disease had nothing of the kind some indigestible pastry a night

be seen nipny evidences of thermal activity ohinemutu is situated on a little slope by the lakeside and lies just out of rotorua town since it was here that tho europeans firt settled ohinemutu is now known as the old township and rotorua town as the new one the distinction which tho terms imply is very apparent in the appearance of the two places on the one hand are narrow lanes and dingy huts on the other splendid streets and handsome houses situated as they are side by side ohinemutu and rotorua afford a strikingillustration of tho difference that exists be tween the old order and the snew th uncivilised or semi-civilised maori and the civilised european there is a main istrcet in ohinemutu and ib contains shops that cater for all and sundry for the european visitor as well as for the maori resident hence the display inside some of them is a curious mixture photos pictures iiaxen kits big blue blankets gaudy ribbons highly-coloured cotton goods trinkets etc froim the mam road a narrow lane turns into the village and winds among the wooden huts of th maori inhabitants the houses are planted with a delightful irregularity they look as if they had been blown to the slope or had been cast out as dice upon it by one of the natives ancient demigods but in building his hut at ohinemutu the maori thinks little of its elegance and much of its safety and convenience his whole endeavour is to erect it as near as possible to the springs and yet not on a site whence possibly the steam may issue to turn his home against his wish into an exaggerated vapour bath in the centre of the village is a diminutive square a kind of gossiping-plaee for the villagers adorning it is a statue of the late queen who is sheltered from the sun and the rain by a wooden canopy one feels rather sorry for the statue in its impictufesque setting the situation of it may be realised if one imagines a bust planted in the centre of the commonest of city lanes facing the square is the meeting-place of the ohinemutu5 a modern building of wood and iron interesting however because of the old carvings which the natives have built into the front of it tama-te-kapua they call thair whare-runanga after the chief who led their ancestors the arawas in their historic emigration from hawaiki jto new zealand emerging from among the houses the village street breaks up into little paths that lead to springs and pools and steam jets some of the springs are tiny things half hidden by the grass and would pass altogether unobserved but for the faint vapour that rises from them others fizz and bubble in holes just large enough to accommodate an egg or in pools wherein a bullock itself might be cooked from some of the pools an overflow strealm runs down to the lake and along t8 side of it on their washing days the wahines squat in a row and in the warm water gratuitously supplied them souse and douse the soiled clothing of their households human nature being much the same under a brown skin as

walk around the water edg-e brings ono to the remains of an old pa a number of stout half-sunken post 1 eonceming which many stories are extant one is to the effect that the pa was the greatest in all the island and that an earthquake came causing the waters of the lake to rise or the land to sink with the result that it was overwhelmed those best able to speak with authority say however nothing is known of the subsidence of the pa and that the stout old pests are but evidences of an event that is singularly mysterious and likely to remain so tne visitor may thus form his own opinion looking at the half-immersed posts and the steaming ground he thinks that what probably happened once may not improbably happen again one day not far from the pa and on a small peninsula running into the lake from the east side qf ohinemutu is a landmark in the shape of a little anglican church called st faith a name one would imagine not inappropriate for a builcling which has hot springs all ground it and one under its floor near to the church is an old native cemetery the bodies of those resting in it are kept warm by the hot waters that well up froim below but whatever be the attractions of ohinemutu the great place of resort with the thousands of persons who annually sojourn at rotorua is undoubtedly whakarewarewa whaka as the little village is usually called is unique in that it provides samples of almost every variety of thermal action to be found in the hot lakes district thus it is that during the tourist season there is to it a constant procession of signtseers to inspect the geysers hot springs boiling pools mud volcanoes and the silicious terrace formations there gathered together between the two places there is a distance of two miles and coaches rumble backwards and forwards over the straight wide uneven and unpaved road the people of rotorua talk already of the electric cars that in th not distant future are to swizz out to this wonderfully interesting place the principal sights of whakarewarewa are located in an undulating valley bounded on the upper side by lev-lying hills and on the lower side by the puarenga stream the valley is filled with manuka scrub except where it has be-on pushed aside by the great terraces or plateaus formed by the deposit of the boiling water thrown up by the geysers the native village rests at the foot and on the end of one of the hills that flank the valley like ohineraulu it is in proximity to the spring most suitable for culinary purposes the coach dropped us near to the bridge crossing the puaraniga stream and

of domett fancy we were taken first to the carved house situated about the centre of the irregularlyplaced kttle houses many of the latter were built on a rocky formation but nevertheless the stability of the foundation of them was not a matter of certainty at any time a collapse migni occur the gable of one house indeed hung directly oer a great yawning pool another matter lending excitement to living at whaksp rewareua is the possibility of a steam hole breaking out suddenly under one resi denoe chimneys are not required at this place where nature heats and boils still there is one it has been plaocd by a european grocer over a eteam bole which broke out under his shop-it was a bother to shift so be built round the vapour and gave it vent through his roof the carved house at whakarewarewa is interesting not cmly for the magnificent work contained therein but also for the strange history attached to it the house during the course of its erection became tapu and an old tohunga warned te waru the arawa chief who had ordered it to be built that seven persons would die if tbe house was proceeded with te waru heeded not the warning amd so lost first second and third wife in succession and two sons thereupon he sold it to mr nelson o whakarewarewa who had it re-moved to its present position and completed strangely enough both the carvers or tohumga engaged died

another which supplies the oil bath in the reserve the water is not really oily but it has a delightfully soft silky feeling caused by its being impregnated with silicates at another place in the cracked and steaming rocky crust were two little wells one fizzed and bubbled and hissed when a few little stones were thrown into it j the other remained eilent and motionless yet they were only a few inches apart the bathing pools in the reserve were interesting because of the human element in them if for no other reason here standing in a basin of water that reached to his waist was a fathe

expect to display that bravery which enabled her to save many lives at wairoa during the eruption very different in appearance was maggie the slight little lady to whom fell the honour of conducting

to australia where she had been lionised or honessed and the hot lakes chronicle was even then publishing a column or two of her experiences weekly she iold us she was glad to get home yes glad to get back to whakarewarewa with its poor little huts its weird surroundings jt3 many forbidding aspects with the maori perhaps even more so than with the european there is no place like home foe it ever so humble led to maggie wharo by blla who ife manifestly very proud of her sister we egned our names in a visitor book that contained the autographs of persons who had come from the four quarters of the world in the spotlessly clean and daintily furnished little whare are many souvenirs received from distinguished visitors many of them are books and these with tier own purchases dickens is her favourite author constituted a worthy little library maggie is educated and speaks english easily and correctly she tells indignantly of a brilliantly dressed visitor who said why maggie hi declare you speak hinglish halmost lias well as hus it is however in tho government reserve which embraces the whole of the little valley beyond the village that the principal sights of the district are to be seen right in the centre of the reserve is the great geyser fissure which supplies no fewer than seven active geysers and a number which are not active though they emit steam and make a rumbling noise as of water boiling below the geysers which are all grouped closoly together have formed with their silicious deposits a terrace of great beauty the formation which is called sinter is mostly of a beautiful white colour though in parts it assumes a shade akin to pink from the whakarewarewa terrace one can obtain they say some little idea of the loveliness that the lost terraces of rotomahana possessed standing at the lower end of tho terraco we looked down on te horo a great woll of water feom 15ft acrcec boiling and bubbling a few feet below tho surface of its rocky basin sometimes te hoio bursts up in a great fountain several feet high and its waters flow into the funnel of great pohutu adjoining that sleeping giant thereupon wpkes and coughs them out ag-din boyond pohutu is playful littlo keren which every few minutes sends up a glistening stream that run 3 over a cliff into the puarcnga river below standing on the sandy riverbank whioi hisses and steams and scorcher the hand placed to it we listened to tho torpedo a little geyser lying in the bed of the stream under the cliff which invariably he-raids the approach of kercru feathery display with a sonos of sharp cracks eereru deposits on tho rocks a slaty screen sinlrr formation different in character from that of the other geysors the sinter descends to within a foot or so of the river and then ends in a series of stalactite formations quaint and beautiful in shape the water runs jcrst over the highest part of the cliff and there strangely enough some sparrows have bravely built their nests at the further side of the terrace getting lazier as ho grows older aud seldom working unless his throat is greased with soap is the famous wairoa geyser a gag placed over his mouth pre vents surreptitious

aro lo bo found however in the scrub gul lirs beyond the geyser plateau here on nvory side of the winding paths were great hole filled with liquid mud porridge pots such as wo had seen at tikitere throwing up all tho while little jets of mud with a horrid flop flop flop sound that clung to the memory tho ugliness and ropulsivoncs of theso sable lazy bubbling pools ot spluttering mud that never cools cannot be imagined one must see tneir dreadful aspects to realise them intermingled with these forbidding sights were however some that pleased and some that oharmed here nestling at the foot of a steep reck was a peaceful sapphire coloured lake in miniature there in amongt the thick scrub was a pool ot liquid salmon-pink in colour below us we could see a third filled with a soft clay white and pure looking every now ana then on the surface of the mud came a great bubble which as it burst outlined for us sometimes a rose and sometimes a lily still more interesting was a little milky pool resting near to a cave that had for many days sheltered a maori chief from his enemies a tiny little bubble came to its surface every second resolving itself as it burst into a delicate outline of things often familiar it seemed as if some invisible artist were busy in the depths below sending up pictures for our delectation interpretations of them of course sometimes differed as we came away from tho pool and made homewards auckland and canterbury were arguing on th point of whether the last outline resembled the north island or a leg of mutton more closely as may be imagined from the foregoing whakarewarewa is a place to be seen not once but many times each visit reveals some fresh aspect of nature strange handiwork in the valley some phenomenath vad not been noticed before when the jird sights begin to pall as of course they do one may then turn to the human element in whakarewarewa which is always interesting often amusing sometimes saddening very poor are the natives of whaka and the village exchequer is helped by an entertainment given by the natives once every week with a view to seeing the maori in the role of entertainer we left rotorua one saturday night and journeyed out to the sulphurous little village it was dark when we reached its approach and we groped round in a thick scotch mist vainly trying to find the wharerunanga it is unpleasant to lose one way in any place but doubly so at whaka when the imagination has been stirred by the sight of boiling springs and liquid pools of nrnd a great stamping on our right at last indicated the direotion we should have taken and in a few minutes more we had reached a long low dark building inside of which all the commotion was taking place accidentally we found the dcor which was opened by a young maori wearing as we saw by the dim light a gaudy scarf a ooat at least three sizes too small for him and trousers the ends of which were steadily working up to his knees and already left visible an inch or two of good solid leg we experienced a severe shock when this proud officer told us there was nothing to pay to get in afterwards we discovered that it is usual at whaka to pay to get out the long youth who acted as usher as well as doorkeeper and whose insignia was a broomhandle conducted us in a manner that was meant to bo graceful to a seat on the opposite-side of the rather dingy but solid-looking hall which except for the forms thatran round the sides of it was entirely unfurnished the audience comprised about a score of europeans and tho performers some 25 women and girls standing in a lino that extended across the hall lengthways almost from end to end some of the dancers liad the women tatoo mark on the chin which consists of perpendicular or curved lines from the mouth to the cliin and which to the european eye is rather a disfigurement the majority however were without this mark in their white dresses coloured sashes rattling piu-piu or flaxen mats and with their dark rich hair hanging loose and plumed with quills of rarest huia tho performers as a whole made a picture decidelly attractive bella in the centre of tho line and in command of it seemed hardly the same person as we had met previously in the darkest corner of the room were several elderly women some smoking some nursing babies all of them watching the proceedings gravely and soberly almost as soon as we were seated the music commenced and the long line plunged into a haka that was inspiriting and fascinating one forgot the dingy hall the tawdry setting and saw only the rythmie movements of the figures in front their quivering hands and the faces that sometimes were strangely impassive and again were lit up with the excitement and ecstasy of the dance different in a measure they say is the haka of to-day from the old and genuine version of it but if different it is more refined probably more graceful following the haka camo the poi first the single then the double the dainty little tilings fluttered and circled in the moving hands like a captive bird trying to escape for a little while the glossy glancing pois were whirled to the music of the concertina then the player ceased and for a while the long line danced the pois to the accompaniment of their own musical chanting then they went back to the haka again with perhaps some little variation and the dancing became infectiotis the women in the corner left their babes and their pipes and joined themselves on to the lino spoiling pernaps with their black rusty work-a-day dress its appearance but adding nevertheless to its interest a stout youth in a red jersey stood up at the rear and began to participate too but the long-legged usher fell on his neck and hauled him back to his seat again the eldest and stoutest of the old ladies led the chanting the mournful cadence in her singing seemed a wail for the vanished glory of the past a sob for the dead whose spirits had set forth for the great reinga one by one the unofficial performers dropped out puffed and panting she alone of them kedt uu to the end there was a brief interval and a big commercial traveller took one of the babie3 on his knee

nothing more has been done in the way of converting it into a range the natives claim that they allowed the volunteers the use of their ground only until they had secured another suitable range aaid this having been acquired they think it only right that it should be made use of for that purpose and therefore they the natives intend to stop firing over their ground after this date verily the local volunteers are long-suffering as they as well as the natives have been put to no end of inconvenience and annoyance owig to the apathy of the defence department in securing and putting up a

line of ivngatiras perhaps to be regarded as the chief in new zealand story on account of their dtcent from ngahue the columbus of the maori race to whom is attributed the first discovery of the land of promise the line of te heu heu is said to be pieserved intact from the arrival of the first canoes and a te heu has since the dawn of story held sway as rangatira in the taupo district thus the scene of the lives of the tribe of te heu heu lies in the volcanic region of the interior of the north wand and his people are familiar from birth with wonderful conditions which create awe and even terror in the minds of those unaccustomed to the neighbourhood of boiling springs spouting geysers and smoking mountain top the story of ngahue the famous ancestor of teheu heu is too interesting to be omitted and was regarded by the maoris n itb the same respect and reverence which the first chapter of genesis has been accorded throughout the christian kra according to the legend accepted by the maoris their ancestors dwelt in a far-off ird across the waves known to them as hwaiki there they enjoyed many comforts and much power but troubles arose and wars and jealousies were rife among thim a great chief named ngahue fought well and 1 long but vas worsted by an attacking tribe his enemies sought for him to take his life but und him not it was said that he had escaped from the island and had sailed away in his canoe far across the horizon line his friends and his enemies alike awaited his return in vain and his fate remained unknown no trace was found either of ngahue or of his canoe many times the sickle of the moon appeared and night succeeding night formed a perfect circle to diminish again to nothingness and still ngahue was lost to his place and name he was in fact forgotten by all but a few longing loving hearts these still watching wistfully the far sea line and pondering over his fate saw approach one wondrous day what at first appeared a strange canoe nearer and nearer drew the magic bark which carried a single passenger yet the strange seafarer knew his goal and approached the shore with confidence the solitary mariner stepped from his canoe it was ngahue returned alive to his kith and kin at first the people were terrified thinking him a spirit visitant but he calmed their fears and told a marvellous tale ho had indeed departed in fear of his enemies and taking food with him had put to sea and sailed out ipon the pathless ocean taking the stars for his guide he followed south and sailed on and on for many days dreading return more than the trackless waste before one joyful morn he saw before him what appeared at first but a t-isin t mist whicli too it siiape and was revealed to him as land ahe-jd nearer and nearer dww the canoe of ngahue and mountain shore and tree grew before his enchanted gaze running has frail boat into a sheltered bay he leaped ashore here indeed was loveliness itself revealed h rested beneath trees laden with fragrant b-erries he drank of fresh water from livimg springs and feasted on many a fat and delicate bird and on delicious eels and cravflsh he found many wonderful things unknown to him and of which he showed specimens to his s-carce credulous tribe come return with me cried ngahue i have come back to lead you to this new and beautiful land wlwre we may dwell in peace free from the fear of our enemies it is a lone land sin uninhabited land and all will be ours take courage and return with me and his trib listened to the words of ngahue and manned many canoes for the great migration ten or 15 canoes were ready at last and when the winter was ended and lengthening day and warm sunshine aave them the promise of calm seas and mild nights under the stars the people of ngahue tribe embarked upon their perilous vovare only the young the strong and the enterprising joined the great expedition the remaining people witnessed thoir departure with wailings but with blowings depart in peace cried an aged sage leave war and strife behind you long th canoes voyaged and often the hearts of the voyagers failed they came to islets in their course and would fain have staved but nganue

terrors use had accustomed him behind his pa issuing from the mountain side boiling water and hot steam was for ever pumped forth by nature strong machinery and the mountain seemed to groan and treutble with the effort but no fear was known to the soul of te heu heu when the time came that the use of firearms spread among the new zealnade-s the tribe of te heu heu obtained the weapons and experimented with them te heu heu encouraged heke in his resistance to europeans to whom jhe never became himself really reconciled he entertained several notable europeans however and especially bishop selwyn whose visit to him is a matter of history efforts were made in vain to convert him with hie tribe to christianity but he was never induced to give any countenance to powers which appeared to him to threaten his own the mana of te heu heu was very great and extended over a wide area of the taupo region this area was declared tapu to europeans so that for many years it was extremely difficult of access scientists who would fain have ventured but who did not dare to defy te heu heu mana were obliged to abandon inspection of tongariro in early days hochstetter and dieffenbach were both deterred from a near approach so that the visit of bishop selwyn and his kind reception by te heu heu wore the more remarkable the region remained little explored until the year 1869 when colonial troops became engaged there and conquered the stronghold of pourere the mountain region is most remarkable and awe-inspiring the very home and stronghold of nature 6 most mysterious forces three mountain peaks where snow and fire meet dominate the scene which is now rapidly becoming accessible even to european settlements it has been thickly inhabited by maoris and it seems very wonderful that they should thus have penetrated the very internal recesses of the country and multiplied there so as to hickly people the land with no means of locomotion no horses to bestride but the canoe for creek or river they yet explored the whole country and removed with surprising celerity from one region to another overcoming mountain fastness forbidding forest or volcanic plain to attack their enemies or to visit their friends te heu heu defied white people to come to his precincts and he believed that the fore6 of nature were at his command he often uttered addresses to the mountains and steaming fumaroles explaining his power and defying their actions lelating the deeds of his ancestors and thoir immunity from harm especially contemptuous was he of the stories which reached him of the white man god of power one can easily fancy the mingled curiosity awe and defiance which moved his spirit as he saw for himself the missionary in shovel hat and black robe armed with te puke tie book which appeared the symbol of his mana the mind of te heu heu strove in vain to penetrate the mystery to te heu heu and these peculiar people pieached an impossible tale endeavounn to induce him to believe that love and peace weie to brng power and joy to man te heu heu scorn found vent in many a scathing proverb and violent harangue to his ancestors embodied in the mountains which gazed inscrutably alike upon his dance of defiance and the steady advance of the mysterious in fluences before which his mana i-eeimd to diminish notwithstanding his contempt the ultimate stronghold or pa of te heu heu which was his home was situated as indif-ated beore on a volcapic 6lop almost under the shadow of tongaiiro te raha was the name of the place and alarming occurrences had more than once happened through eccentricities of nature forces teheu heu was often warned of the danger of the situation but regarded 6uch warnings with contempt having too much confidence in himself and his own greatness and cunning to believe that nature might deceive him slips had occurred on the mountain side and waters had been diverted from their course and turned into new channels immense changes occur

description of this painful process which lays him ud for six weeks part iv description of rutherford portrait his experiences of the tapu he acsompanies the chief amawahi into the interior the fate of hia various comrades is told as one by ono they aro scattered amongst the maoris the arrival at the kairiga of amawahi is marked by the sacrifice of a slave girl who is cooked and eaten notes on plants animals and native life and further adventures part v natural features the kainga or fortified pa of the chief amawahi appears to hav bean visited soon after rutherfords arrival by a series of earthquake shocks it was probably within the thermal district rutnerford expressly states and ho is tne only authority who docs so that many fin veins of coal crop out from the sides of certain mountains in the interior of the north island he mentions also seeing beds of oyster shells three feet under the surface of the ground a hundred miles from the coast no doubt these had a similar or earthquake origin to thoso reefs of actual oyster shells wo know to exist on part of glenmark he also relates that there isa plain about a mile square near the east gape the surface of which is covered with grass beneath which is a bright yellow dust like sulphur to the depth of several feet which blisters the skin and is somewhat warm murder of his last comrade for the first year says rutherford we spent our time chiefly in fishing and shooting for the chief had a capital double-barrelled fowling piece as well as plenty of powder and duckshot all of which ho had plundered from the agnes he used to lend me this gun whenever i had a mind to go shooting pigeonsy swamphens or ducks though he seldom came himself at last it happened that amawahi went to a feast at another village and mv comrade george jones and i were left at home with nobody but a few slaves and the chiefs mother an old woman who was sick and attended by a tohunga this priest or physician or both combined remained as is customary night and day with his patient in case of death these native i doctors are brought before a court 01 inquiry composed of all the chiefs of the tribe in the neighbourhood now it so happened as ill-luck would have it that my comrade chanced to lend hia 1 knife to a slave to cut some rushes to repair a hut and when this was done he received it back again soon after he and i killed a pig from which we cut a portion into small pieces and put them into an iron pot along with some potatoes also peeled with our knives and the sick woman ate some of these potatoes in the presence of the doe tor next morning she died and th chief and the rest of his family at once returned to the village hiving described with much particularity the various ceremonies of the tangi which in this case lasted three days rutherford comes to another trao-edy the native doctor being obliged by the close inquiries or the chiefs to account for the loss or his patient seems to have called attention to the incident of the knife at last he continues the doctor having retired from the ring an old chief with three or four white feathers stuck in his hair stepped forward and addressed the meeting in his opinion the old woman had died through eating potatoes peeled by a white man knife after it had been used by a slave to cut rushes to repair a house on which account he thought mat the white man to whom the knife belonged should be killed which would be a great honour conferred on the memory of the dead woman 7 meanwhile poor jones stood trembling and unable to speak with fear in vain rutherford realising the awful peril cf his last companion rushod frantically into the ring and to the best of his ability pointed out that the knife had been used in ignorance in vain he pleaded with amawahi and besought his daughters and his wife to move him to mercy the chief remained motionless and suddenly he o the white feathers rushing at the white man scattered his brains around with a heavy greenstone mere and so at last our hero found himself entirely alone jones body was buried and not eaten probably with the idea of its acting as an escort to the old woman on her trip to the kingdom of the hereafter after three months the woman body was disinterred and the bones scraped washed and enclosed in a box lashed to the top of a pest rutherford marriage taught by the murder of his comrade on how slight a tenure he held his life and exposed every moment to the chance of provoking their capricious cruelty the english sailor passed tho next twelve months in trepidation one of the greatest inconveniences he now began to feel arose from the wearing out of his clothes which despite patching and tacidng tell to pieces behold him at last in true native costume namely a white flax mat coming to the knees and bareheaded and barefooted for the first sixteen months of his residence in the village he kept a reckoning of days by notches on a stick but soon lost all count at last it happened one day continues ho whilst x we were all assembled at a feast amawahi called me to him in the presence of several more chiefs and shaving told them of my skill in shooting and fishing concluded by saying that he wished to mak m a chief upon this my hair was cub wiui aii oyster-shell after the manner ol that of the chiefs i now put on a mat covered with red ochie and oil and my head and face were anointed with tho same composition by a chief daughter i receivod at the same time a andsomo greenstone mere which i afterwards always carrid amawahi now advised me to take two or three wives it being the custom for the chiefs to have as many as they think proper and i consented to take two about sixty women were then brought up before me none of whom however pleased me so i refused to have any of them on this amawahi told me i was tabooed for three days at the end of which he would take me to his brothers camp where i should find plenty of women that would pleaso me accordingly we went to his brother at the time appointed when several women were brought up before us but having cast ray eyes on amawahfs two daughters i went up to the eldest and said that would choose her on this she immediately laughed and ran away but the natives pursued and caught her she then walked quietly with me to her father but hung her head and continued laughing after this rough-and-ready courtship which withal has certain features of civilisation we are not surprised to hear that amawahi called his other daughter to him who also came laughing and he advised me to take them both rutherford now seems to have con sidered it advisable to put the momentous question to the young ladies thenisoles when i asked them if they weve railing to go with me they each replied yes i believe so on this amawahi directed us all three to go homp together which we did these simple nuptials were it appears further solemnised by much feasting and dancing connubial felicity my eldest wife name continues rutherford was eshon and that of my youngest epecka they were both handsome mild and good-tempered when away for any length of time i used to tnke epecka along with me and leave eshon at home the chiefs wives are never jealous of each other but live in great harmony the oldest is always considered the head wife a woman who is found guilty of unfaithfulness is put to death many chiefs take wives from amongst the slaves but any child so born is treated as a slave like its mother maori music in describing the festivities on the occasion of his own wedding rutherford says that the was a lot of feasting and dancing particularly a dasca or game called kani-kani performed by women part of this consisted of the flourishing of muskets but he says except singing thpy have no music in this country now we of course know this to be a mistake wind instruments in the nature of fifes or flutes often made from human bnes were met with bycook and others at the bay of islands at the end of the eighteenth century some of them wero beautifully calved but what poor rutherford did observe was their hoa rible inattention to personal cleanliness all the natives he tells us are over-run with vermin their way of destroying them in their mats is by steaming and smoking on such occar sions the women are very active in devouring the vermin eating them greedily y n to be

haupu pickets kept watch on the edge if the clearing and more than once jhey imagined they heard stealthy lootfalls the breaking of branches the whispers of enemies in the woods these dangers however were things of the imagination nevertheless it was an anxious night in the lonely kainga and when morning came the people decided o abandon their camp and bury themselves still deeper in the

spent on that terrible trail the roughest wildest part of the taranalu hinterlaud fording rivere pushing through matted jungles climbing wooded precipices lowering their swags down perpendicular cliffs and swinging themselves down by forest vines and creper they emerged at last a weary little band on the banks of the waitara about thirty miles from the mouth of that river all around towered the densely forested blue ranges the high banks of the winding waitara fell precipitously to its rapid-whitened waters on the cliff-top where they left the forest there was a little maori camp here the fugitives were met and ordered to the kawau pa a settlement in a strategically-chosen position overlooking the river at the kawau titokowaru and the bulk of his folfowers were assembled and the arrival of their long-expecfed friends from the patea was made the occasion for a great rejoicing in the way of dancing of war-dances the chanting of powhiris of welcome and the inevitable finale a tangi for the dead warriors of the tribes as rupe and his pakeha bent and their companions marched slowly into the marae of the war-chief camp their eyes on the ground the village women and girv waved

kaanga-pirau bent was working away cleaning out the steeping-pool when hi chief cam up and found fault with him because he was not working hard enough i made him some answer which didnt please him says bent whereupon he flew into a terrible rage and rushed at me hke a tiger i stooped and caught him by the leg and he fell into the muddy pool up he jumped in a foaming passion and ran to the pa got out his gun and loaded it to shoot me but his wife rushed at him took the gun out of his hands and told me to hurry down to the other village w-here i would be safe so i ran to the riverbank loosed a small canoe and paddled down the river to the lower pa wliere i was kindly received and taken into my old friend hakopa house and x lived and worked there for some months meanwhile titokowaru

together a band of his warrior the remnant of the once evervictorious tekau-ma-rua he paraded them in the marae of the kawau pa and farewelling his people took his old place at the head of the taua

and his henohmen fought no more but betook themselves to the great camp of te whiti the prophet who preached peace peace and prophesied sundry supernatural ways by which the maori would come into hie own again a quaint incident of those wild old days on the waitara narrated by bent i worth the telling as an illustration of the whimsically variable temper of the miaori and of hie truly hibernian love of a free fight the war had long been over and some hapus of the tribes on the upper river talked of selling their lands to the whites certain of the chiefs had been down at waitara township and m new plymouth and there they had been approached by the agentsof the government but the more conservative of the hauhaus stoutly held out against land-selling and against any dealings with the hated pakeha and the difference of opinion led to frequent quarrels one day a council of all the inhabitants of the kawau and neighbouring villages was held on the marae of the pa for the purpose of discussing the land-selling proposals long and bitter were the speeches speaker after speaker taki d up and down the marae and worked himself up into a fury of excitement two old chiefs tattooed veterans of the war their long hair adorned with feathers native weapons in their hands angrily assailed each other one advocated the sale of surplus lands the other vigorously opposed it and insisted on the principle of maori land for maori men fawn argument they came to hurling abusive threats at each other at last one of the old fellows furiously hurled hi weapon a sharp weeden spear at he other who dged it and cleverly caught it near the butt end as it whistled past him he instantly smartly returned it to its owner spearing him through the leg nest two women wef at it women of rank fher who considered themselves entitl to eqh debating voice with the men-folk their power of rhetoric and inventive exhausted in succession they fell on each other very literally tooth and nail biting hair-pulling scratching screaming in their struggle they tote most of each other clothes off and two nearly nude amazons raped round the marae one of the wild women a young chieftain ess her long hair streaming behind her her pendant breasts qiiiyering her shoulders bleeding seized a canoe paddle and struck her antagonist a blow across the naked back with it then the whole tribe were into the battle with sticks paddles spears and any weapon they could lay their hands on men and women alike it was a real faction fight fortunately the people had left their guns in their whares and were too intent upon their hand-to-hand encounter to run for their firearms kimble bent stood on one side watching the squabble he was ckee to the river-bank where the canoes were tied up presently one of the maoris ran down to the water side with an axe and began furiously cutting anvay at his antagonists canoes others ran to the oooking hangis and with burning sticks from the ovens sat fire to some of the thatched houses in the kainga soon there was a pretty blaze and half the village was burned diiwn in a few minutes the whare in which bent was living was fired and destroyed but he ran up and was just in time to save what few clothes he possessed in half an hour time the people had cooled down and the trouble was ovftr then a quaintly hibernian people h maoris surely i they begafl o weep over their quarrel and ft on each other necks or rather pressed each other noses to make up for the hard words and blowe they had just exchanged and eat to work to rebuild the dwellings they had destroyed in their hasty anger another characteristic incident of those wild rough-and-ready days in the bush is thus briefly recounted by the old pakeha-maori a hauhau named rongowhenua who was a resident of the kawua kainga elopod into the bush with another man wife the husband took his gun and went out hunting for the couple after travelling same tan miles through the bush he saw a curl of amoke rising near the top of a hill called taramauku he stalked his game and on reaching the camp found his wife and her lover lying asleep undr a tree raising hie gun he hot rongovlienua dead through the head then he took his terrified wife back witli him to the settlement the couple afterwa-rds went to parihaka te whiti village where the wife died according to maori report she was fatally bewitched makutu by her husband in punishment for another act of misbehaviour the minds of these isolated forestdsvellers were saturated with superstition with strange beliefs that were a reflex of the vast untrimined places of nature in which they lived thevhice man too almost came to believe in the tales of saurian-like tariiwhastand water-demons in the patupaiarebe and 1 macro the foreefc-fairies and forestgiants in the occult malevolence of the tapu and makutu spells night after night in the crowded wharepunis the tales of old were told until every person of the community became perfectly acquainted with the folk-lore and the unwritten history of his tribe one story related by bent is illustrative of the maori belief up to quite modern days in malignant beings which made their homes in lonely waters and in caves the dreaded tani-i wha the tale of the taniwha of the kopua one day this waa in the early seventies an old man named te maire left the kawau landing in his canoe and paddled down the waitara to a place called te kopua the site of an ancient vilfcge the object of his expedition was to procure dry resinous strips of the rirau pine for the purpose of making torches to be used in catching piharau lampreys in the river at night after getting the wood he required he started on the return paddle to his home on the way to the kawau he disappeared and was never seen again alive no doubt he overbalanced and fell into the river while poling his canoe up one of the small rapids near the kopua that afternoon a canoe crew of five men from the kawau including kimble bent were paddling down th river to a fieftlernent a few miles distant when they caught efeht of the old mail emoty canoe drifting down with the swift current as they approached it it sped away rapidly before them and at last stranded on a shingle bank in a bend of the river in it they found te maire s jarun and a young piqj which the vanished man had evidently caught in the bush while on his torchmakinje expedition bent maori companions immediately solved in their own way the mystery of their tribesman disappearance there is a taniwha there they said a fearful water monster that dwells in a deen still pool under te kopua banks he has stretched forth his long claws and dragged the old fellow down to his den the mfori canoeists made baste t-n quit the dead man craft and plied their paddles with unusual energy until they reached their destination on the shore below they told their story and that evening a meeting of the village peonle was held in the wharepum to discuss the mystery for hours the wiseacres of the bushhamlet solemnly debated the circumstances and each canoeist in turn had tr give his account of the affair and advance his theory at last it was decided that there was no possible doubt that the taniwha of the river had seized te maire and drowifed him there must of course be a reason for no taniwha of any repute would take such an extreme step without some good cause te maire had violated the tapu of the deserted village he had in all probability taken some dry rimu from an old house that stood there and which was sacred because a chief had died in it goodness knows how lon ago tke river-erod had very properly punished him with death it was the penalty of infringing the law of il tapu the next day and for pome days thereafter canoe crews hunted the river for the old man body but found it not at last a woman at the lower settlement on going down to the river one morning to draw water spied the body of the mising man hansing in the branches of a prostrate kabikatea tree on the opposite side of the river about four feet above the water the question was how did the body get there entangled in the branches that height above the river for there had been no flood no noticeable rise or fall in the level of the river the answer was plain to the mind of the maori he summed it all up iv two words te taniwha the river-monster after grabbing te maire from his canoe and detaining him awhile in his watery grave had draered the body away down-stream and hnntc it ut in the tree-branches opposite the village so that the dead man peonle should have no difficulty in recovering it and in giving it decent burial a truly thoughtful and considerate taniwha", "famous maori chiefs leader qf a great race by e m dunlop notv te heb heu chief of taupo an rights reserved the mighty chief of taupo wibli whom our story is now concerned was one of a line of rangatiras who took in succession the name of te heu heu and who dominated the tribes living in the shadow of the tongariro volcanic group te heu heu was contemporary with hongi te raiiparaha and heke land he watched with uitense interest the struggle taking place in his country between the opposing forces of savagery and those of the civilisation of which he remained to the end the implacable foe he never consented to the jidvance of the white man or suffered lis presence in his own dominions although on rare occasions driven ly curiosity and desire he entertained on a passing visit more than one european notability by lineage and tradition te heu heu vas held and held himself in greater honour than any other new zealand chief for he was the representative of ngahue the columbus of maori story when the ancestors of our maoris lived in the far-off land of hawaiki they enjoyed many comforts and muoh yower but troubles arose and wars md jealousies were rife among them great chief named ngahue fought veil and long but he was worsted h ian attacking tribe all was lost and 1 one moonlight night to escape lis enemies he leaped into his canoe and put out far to sea his distant barque descried by his friends rocked in the cugon-ray down which he sailed away across the far horizon line his onemies sought for him in vain to take iiis life but found him not his friends whispered together and awaited his return but there was no sign and his fate remained unknown no trace was found either of ngahue or of his canoe many times n the sickle of the moon ippeared and night succeeding night formed a perfect circle to diminish again to nothingness and still the jhief was lost to his place and name he was in fact forgotten by all but a few longing loving hearts these still i watching wistfully the far sea line and pondering over his fate saw approach one wondrous day what at first appeared a strange canoe nearer and nearer drew the mystic barque which carried a single passenger yet the strange j seafarer knew his goal and approached the shore with confidence the solitary mariner stepped from the canoe ft was ngahue returned alive to his kith and kin at first his people were terrified thinking him a spirit visitant but he calmed their fears and told a marvellous tale he had indeed departed in fear of ins enemies and taking food with him i had put out to sea and sailed out upon the pathless ocean taking the stars for his guide he followed south and sailed on and on for many days dreading return more than the trackless waste before him one joyful morn he saw before him what appeared at first but a rising mist which took shape and was revealed to him as land ahead 1 nearer and nearer drew the cane of ngahue and mountain shore and tree grew bef are his enchanted gaze running his frail boat into a sheltered bay he leaped ashore here indeed was loveliness itself revealed he rested beneath trees laden with fragrant berries j he drank of fresh water from living springs and feasted on many a fat and delicate bird and on delicious eels and crayfish he found many wonderful things unknown to him and of which he showed specimens to his scarce credulous tribe come return with me cried ngahue a i have come back to lead you to this new and beautiful land where we may dwell in peace free from the fear of our enemies it is a lone land an uninhabited land and all will be ours take courage and return with me i and his tribe listened to the words of ngahue and nianned maay canoes for the great migration ten or fifteen canoes were ready at last and when the winter was ended and lengthening days and warm sunshine gave the promise of oalrn seas and mild nights under the stars the people of ngahue tribe embarked upon their perilous voyage only the young the strong and the enterprising joined the great expedition the remaining people witnessed their departure with wailings but with blessings depart in peace i cried an aged sage leave war and strife behind you long the canoes voyaged and often the hearts of the voyagers failed they came to islets in their course and would fain have stayed but ngahue urged them on this is not the land we seek declared the intrepd leader and prtsuading them to re-einbariv he guided their course until that eventful morn when even as he had promised the long white cloud appeared upon the horizon shaking iself free of sea-mist and fog there arcse before their gaze ever strengthening from distant blue to purple brown and green a land to which they drew nearer and nearer leaping at last to chore tliey found the talcs he told them true such was ngahue great exploit and such was the

are in certain seasons the breeding places oi innumerable sea birds strange as it seems they fly far inland from the bay of plenty to nest upon the slopes of ngauruhohe in early summer the ground was thick with fledglings which were easily caught and were potted by the maoris and served up as a delicious food there was thus plenty of variety and the people of the tribes of te heu heu waxed fat and strong and held all the land and declared the mountain saored and tapu to all except their own kin mount ruapehu the topmost peak of ngauruhohe possesses a marvellous crater lake which has ever been the cause of curiosity and alarm even during the present year the movements of this remarkable lake which is in reality an active geyser have given rise to varied rumours of an alarming nature at

utmost violence for fully a minute and it was succeeded at very short intervals by smaller vibrations for the best part of an hour while further tremors continued during the afternoon houses rocked like ships in a stormy sea and chimneys crashed in hundreds all over the town as well as the ceilings of numerous buildings and in one or two instances large pieces of cornice and external masonry fell to the ground in the hotels extensive losses resulted from the throwing of bottles from the shelves and the chemists fared equally badly in places clouds of dust mingled vyith the smoke from fires which were agitated by the jolting and swinging but fortunately there was no call ior the services of the fire brigade the creaking and rattle as the buildings strained under the upheaval and the rushing noise which came from a great slide of metal at the cobden quarry made the phenomenon more alarming than anything of the kind ever known here women in houses and girls in the schools fainted and there was a general stampede into the streets in dozens of places chimneys came through roofs and several very narrow escapes are reported dozens more chimneys were left in a dangerous state fissures in the ground the footpaths on the seaward side of the town now exhibit fissures in all directions there are long narrow ones along richmond quay one extending for over fifty yards but the most remarkable result was in blaketown adjacent to the beach where a deep crack opened in a garden through which there welled up creamy silt and salt water spreading a deposit over an area of about twenty or thirty square yards every footpath in blaketown had its asphalt cracked the main traffic bridge leading to blaketown was rendered impassable through the road falling at either end the drop on the seaward side being about two feet three deep fissures extending each a distance of nearly a hundred feet and widening in places to more than a yard opened up in the road and there is a narrow one on the landward side the bridge itself was evidently pushed westward fully a foot causing the caps on the piles at that end to split and turn oyer fissures also opened in the road at omoto

the beginning of the main shock which may have had a submarine origin the tale of the clocks the exact time at which the big shock began was recorded at various post offices and a comparison indi cates the direction from which it started it was felt at greymputhat 1019 am just two minutes later than it was reported at reef ton and a minute sooner than the hokitika officials noticed it that might indicate that the centre of the subsidence was in a northerly direction it has been said that it was felt at blaketown slightly before itreached greymouth but that cannot be proved there were minor tremors early in the morning the first oneabout 1250 am and for at least an hour afterwards there were others quite small but easily discernible then at 725 am there wasa shock felt by a great

religious or otherwise and they liave determined to hold out aeainst the remonstrances of the over-captious has the fern-leaf received any adequate recognition for influence in the maori style of

such a one as had not been seen in this neighborhood since 1854 which overspread the flat lands of meanee papakura and other districts and did a large amount of damage to fences pastures and improvements generally as well as to roads and bridges the catalogue of disasters if not so serious as was at first anticipated was yet a very sad onesome having had their all swept away whilst others suffered to an extent which will cramp their means and energies for a long time to come upon the water subsiding it was naturally hoped that the worst had been experienced unfortunately it was not so on monday last after a day or two of fine weather rain again began to fall and continued without intermission during the whole of monday night on tuesday morning the guage indicated a fall of nearly 5 inches and it rained throughout the greater part of the day this taken in conjunction with the fact that spring tides would be at their full that evening caused some apprehension for the safety even of property on the spit and other parts of the town especially as the wind was southeasterly and the sea in the bay running high at 8 pm and on wednesday at 8 am the water rose to a most unusual height several inches higher than it did in march last it covered waghora street and the whole of the lower part of olive square and carlyle street entering several houses which had always been supposed wholly beyond the reach of the worst flood that could come fortunately the sea had rather subsided than otherwise and little damage was done from outside had it been otherwise serious disaster to the spit would have been the inevitable consequence as it is it is much curtailed iv width and the next gale may do serious injury but any loss or inconvenience felt by residents in town was as nothing in comparison with what was suffered by those country settlers who were exposed to the ravages of the flood and we almost feel as if it were selfish to mention napier at all in connection with the calamity from the barrack hill on wednesday morning a commanding view was obtained of the meanee and pakowhauplains and the prospect was a dreary one indeed where smiling paddocks lately greeted the eye nothing was to be seen but a waste of waters relieved only by the settlers houses and the clumps of trees which indicated the site of a homestead here and there at the bridge and other parts of meanee flat there were houses which the water had not reached but these we regret to say were the exception rather than the rule although we are but imperfectly in possession of particulars we append such details as are to hand the present flood was considerably higher than the preceding one except in clive and the flat country lying between the ngaruroro and the tuki tuki this district enjoyed comparative immunity consequent on the two rivers overflowing their banks in different directions the ngaruroro towards napier and the tuki tuki towards cape kidnappers the ngaruroro ran over in several places at puketapu head of the plains where the river has a large shingle bed and no height of bank from this point the flood water spread over the heretaunga plains and crossed the ohivia and tutaekuri waimate streams the latter unable to carry the additional body of water thus thrown upon it broke over above the little bush and discharged large quantities on to the papakura block the second leakage of the ngaruroro was opposite karamu causing the big bush and the country about it to be flooded the third was just above mr h parker house on the lower pokowhai plains which sent another volume of water into the lower papakura block land which had not been flooded within the memory of the oldest inhabitant was under water pakowhai in particular which no native remembers having been in this state waa nearly all submerged and the resident natives were firing signals of distress on tuesday evening the back water here is described as having risen to two and a-half feet above the actual river bank the ngaruroro being eased in this way and having a straight course and excellent mouth did not further overflow till within half a mile of its mouthj when the influence of the sea backing up the water began to be felt the new bridge has stood the strain well throughout although at one time during the first flood it was severely tried through a large quantity of wire fencing having caught on the piles and formed a net for the retention of trees posts canoes c which were coming down in great quantity fortunately mr weber in company with mr w miller arrived on the spot at the critical moment and by descending and cutting the wire relieved the now structure from a position of great dauger we would here take occasion to mention the very great exertions made by mr weber to visit the outlying districts and render what assistance he could while the flood prevailed no consideration of personal comfort or even of personal safety prevented him from doing what he deemed hia duty under the very trying circumstances with which he was surrounded although the ngaruroro bridge passed unscathed through the ordeal not so the waitangi bridge which broke down on the night of wednesday two of the piles on the northern side having been undermined by the heavy scour and given way while the approaches were very seriously injured this structure if a lesson is to be taker from the experience of the last few days will have to be greatly lengthened ahc a considerable interruption to traffic wil be the inevitable consequence i the tutaekuri would seem to have carried a larger body of water this time thai during last fresh it also broke out ir several places it sent one stream over th motiu flats and another near the littu busb into the

danger lashed it with ropes so that when the water rose it swung as it were to its moorings mr mcmurray house tareha bridge is under usual circumstances so far removed from the water as to make one smile at the idea of danger yet on wednesday morning there were 12 inches of water in his parlour and the house itself was quite insulated by the tremendous volume of water that swept down the water in his case was 7 inches higher than on the former occasion the report of one fatal accident has reached vs that of an aged maori who was stooping over the tutaekuri at paora kawhatu kainga to catch drift wood and who fell in and was drowned various casualties however are sure to have occurred if not of so serious a nature as the one we refer to the tuki tuki made a small breach above matahiwi on the clive side and a larger one in the direction of cape kidnappers fortunately its bed is now wide and its mouth good and it did not overflow further down from petane we learn that the valley was nearly all under water for a short time fortunately the supplementary mouth as it may be termed was well open and the waters escaped with rapidity we hear of some very bad landslips one in particular having fallen in unpleasant proximity to the house of the messrs carr the water was at its height on tuesday night or wednesday morning since then it has fallen rapidly with many parts of the country there has not as yet been any communication and little is known as to losses of stock o it is greatly feared however that some serious losses of sheep have occurred upwards of 250 carcases apparently carried down the ngaruroro having been washed up upon the beach outside in the matter of fencing we do not suppose that the first flood left much scope for the ravages of the second miles upon miles having then been buried in the mud and of course time has not afforded of anything in the shape of repairs having been done since we hear of an immense number of posts left high and dry from last flood having been carried out to sea by this they passed through the mouth of the harbour in great quantity the beach facing the bay is strewed with trees tufts of grass and of toi toi thistles in immense numbers carcases of dead sheep pieces of fencing drift-wood and all the other evidences of a heavy flood", "", "chatham islands from the new zealand government gazette january 14 office of

your letter of the 14th ultimo appointing me your deputy for the purpose of proceeding to the chatham islands to carry out the instructions of his excellency government enclosed therein i have the honor to inform you that i proceeded thither by the schooner esther which vessel sailed from here on the 30th ultimo and returned again on the 17th instant the letter from the office of the commissioner of customs of the 14th of august last enclosed for my guidance directed me to ascertain the exact position of mr shand accounts and to report generally on the subject of the customs establishment at the chatham islands also to furnish statistical information respecting the trade population and resources of those islands in submitting o you my report for the information of the honorable the commissioner of customs i shall endeavour to notice each of the subjects to which my attention has been directed in the order in which they stand in the paragraph quoted above respecting the trade of the chatham islands i have to submit the following information which i gathered from various sources and believe to be correct from the year 1841 to about 1854 four to six whaling ships generally visited the islands every year for supplies during the succeeding years 1855 to 1857 when potatoes were in such demand for the australian market their visits became less frequent and for the last three years 1858 1859 and 1860 they have principally touched at pitt island and procured supplies from the two europeans messrs hunt and keignault resident there in 1860 the natives who up to that time had always resided on the main island found that vessels from australia ceased to arrive for their potatoes and that the whaling ships visited the neighbouringisland only so a number of them went across and established themselves there also so as to be able to obtain a share of the trade during that year i understand nine whaling ships called there but as many of them i am told purchased the supplies they required for cash few dutiable articles were landed from them however this may be certain it is that on the main island i found with the exception of the tobacco as i said before no evidence of any quantity of dutiable goods having been landed there for some time the european residents had long been without tea sugar and such like articles and the natives i observed were becoming so badly off for clothing that the women were beginning to make mats again an occupation that they had previously abandoned for years potatoes are at present almost the only things grown large crops of which are raised year after year from the same ground with very little labour it has been almost exclusively for these that the trade to the islands lias hitherto boon carried on very little wheat or grain of any kind has been raised since the potatoes first began to realize such high prices one year the maoris wore paid as much as six pounds a ton for them by the traders from australia in 1854 about 2000 tons were shipped lor sydney and melbourne in the purchase of which it is estimated that the traders spent about 5000 in cash and as much more in goods altogether from 1854 to 185g inclusive about 7000 tons were exported and it was during that time that so many vessels visited the islands and that a considerable trade was carried on at present there is scarcely any sign among the natives of the prosperity they attained to in those years beyond the number of horses which they possess as most of the money they received for their produce was soon most foolishly dissipated in 1859 the whole potato crop about 2000 tons rotted in the ground for want of purchasers in 1860 five vessels arrived from australia and took away about 450 tons and three vessels from new zealand shipped about 150 tons more these all cost on an average 3 per ton so that hist year about 1800 rnoßt part in trade was laid out on the islands tho goods taken from new zealand were no doubt all duty paid at tho ports at which they were shipped in consequenco of those few vessels calling lust yoar tho natives again made large plantations both maoris and europeans assured me that the crop of the present season would yield at least 2000 tons and from what i saw myself i believe this to bo a low estimate at wuitangi alone there was at least 200 tons of the finest potatoes i ever saw brought into the pah ready for shipment with the exception of 160 tons shipped for wellington all this largo crop like that of 1859 must rot on the ground the esther lias been the only vessel that has called to load this year in the three trips she has made there have been shipped 732 bushels of wheat 162 tons of potatoes and about 1200 pounds of wool the cost of this would be about 350 and more than two-thirds of this was paid for in goodsduty paid ill new zealand the natives this year have been glad to take a ton for their potatoes delivered on board the vessel the price of wheat hag been 4s a bushel in former years there were several whaling stations on the main island and last year the maories hud some boats out and obtained a few tuns of oil but this enterprise has now altogether ceased the european population of the chatham islands is now very small beyond the three german settlers and their families and mr shand and family on the main island and the families of messrs hunt and reignault on pitt island there are not a dozen altogether and most of these live among the maories and cultivate small plots of ground or taupas in common with them i enclose a return which shews the total number to be forty-six only viz thirty-three adults and thirteen children i found great difficulty at first in my endeavours to ascertain the present number of maories and aborigines all the estimates both by natives and europeans differed very widely shortly after my arrival however a large number of natives assembled at kaingaroa to see me and i took some pains to induce them to make a complete list of the names of all the native inhabitants of the different settlements round the island in this i succeeded and believe the list i procured of which i beg to enclose a copy to be perfectly correct as i had several opportunities of testing its accuracy i enclose also an abstract of this nominal list which shows the native population to be as follows aborigines or moriorig 160 maories 413 half-castes by european fathers 17 total 590 five hundred and ninety souls from this return it will be seen that the natives must be rapidly on the decline as there are only sixty-four children to five hundred and nine adults at kaingaroa and the adjacent kaingas which comprise about half of the population thirty-four nearly all adults have died since 1856 and seventeen only have been born in the same period several years ago the lord bishop of new zealand took a list similar to the one i obtained and then the natives i was told numbered over a thousand itwould be interesting now to compare the two lists so as to ascertain the exact rate of decrease it should be noted that in addition to those who have died about thirty left for taranaki by the esther in 1859 everywhere that i met the poor morioris i found them delighted to see me but the maories appeared to exercise a most suspicious vigilance over their actions and rarely left them a moment alone to talk to me the miserable remnant of this ill-used people i believe cling most tenaciously to the belief that his excellency government will ere long restore them to freedom and to the possession of some portion of the land which was so cruelly wrested from them by their maori conquerors it is estimated that there must have been three thousand aborigines on the island when the maories first reached there twenty-flve years ago the greater part of these were slaughtered at once and the remainder subjected to a state of most oppressive slavery of late years however their condition has much improved i believe they are not now beaten or ill-used and they are allowed to cultivate the ground for their own benefit in common with the maories the men are also now allowed to take wives which they were not formerly permitted to do but are still prohibited from marrying maori women only two instances have occurred of morion men having taken maori wives and in one of these the woman was formerly a slave in new zealand the maoris have a large number of horses there must be nearly five hundred now on the island as upwards of a hundred principally breeding mares were brought down by the traders from sydney in the years 1853-54-55 there must be also about a thousand head of cattle but most of these are running wild in the bush i observed everywhere fine milk cows and working bullocks in excellent condition about the pahs at tapuange the maoris have from eighty to a hundred sheep but of these they take so little care that the dogs destroy them faster than they can increase the europeans have about thirteen hundred sheep which thrive pretty well half of these are on pitt island and belong to mr hunt i regret very much that i am not able to offer any correct estimate of the size of the islands or of the quantity of available land as i have never seen a chart of them and the short time i was there i had little opportunity of gathering reliable information on these points nor had i an opportunity of visiting pitt island but persons who had been there described it to be of small extent covered with bush throughout almost entirely steep hilly land with no good harbour and only two places where a landing can be effected with any safety as to the resources of the islands the best information i can supply i think will be a short description of the nature and quality of the soil and its productions in the centre of the main island which is nearly all low and undulating there is a large salt-water or brackish lake occupying fully one-third of its area this lake has a hard sandy bottom and is easily fordable over about half of its extent when the mouth is open at the point where its waters flow into the sea at times however after heavy gales of wind i believe this is closed up and then it is too deep to be crossed except in boats a large portion of it is always very deep nearly all round the sea coast there is a belt o bush varying in width from a mile or more down to one or two hundred yards this portion comprises the best land between it and the lake the ground is open and is covered either with flax or with rushes low fern and a kind of heather the flax land is generally good the other is mostly wet and swampy even on the highest parts but it could all be easily drained as it appears to be everywhere considerably above the level of the lake the soil throughout is light and rich and is composed principally of peat mixed with fine quartz sand varying in their proportions in different places in some parts near the sea coast the quartz sand entirely prevails forming long lines of sand hills in others tho ground is composed exclusively of peat in many places in the open ground this fine white quartz is so thickly strewn over the surface as to present the appearance of a recent fall of snow the bush land which is the only part that has yet been cultivated is the richest that i have ever seen it sustains a dense growth of vegetation and when cleared yields abundant crops of the same kind for many years in succession wheat oats and barley have been cultivated with great success all the english fruit trees such as the apple pear peach plum and cherry c grow most luxuriantly and bear well anything that is cultivated in the middle island of new zealand would do well i have no doubt at the chatham islands as the climate and temperature must be much alike the crops never suffer from drought and no blight of any kind has yet made its appearance a change of seed wheat is much required as tho sort the maories now have from want of proper care and attention has much deteriorated if a few bushels of really good seed wheat and barley could be sent down for distribution among tho natives it would havo a moat beneficial effect anil would perhaps bo the menus of inducing them to cultivate moro grain for which there would always bo a stondy demand at remunerative prices mid they would then not huvo the mortification of seeing their whole year labour thrown away ns is now the case in consequence of potatoes being the only crop cultivated for which as i havo before pointed out there is often no purchaser at all great benefit would also result from sending at the samo lime white clover seed which if only scattered over the abandoned maori cultivations would soon rapidly spread over the island besides converting these waste places into excellent pasturage at almost all the pahs there are small patches of english trrass which look rich and luxuriant but i did not see any clover the principal woodß are the karaka akeake matepo hoho and karemu i enclose a list of all the trees that are found on the island with a brief description showing the size they grow to and the various uses for which they are applicable stone suitable for rough building purposes and plentiful enough is to be had in some parts and limestone also but in other places scarcely a stone of any kind can be found the islands are not visited by earthquakes only once since the europeans have been there has a slight tremor been felt this was about seventeen years ago with the wind offshore vessels can call at almost every part of the main island and things may be shipped at one time or other from all the native settlements waitangi is a good roadstead where a vessel with good ground tackle may lay with almost any wind kaingaroa is a good harbour but small with two and a half fathoms at low water here too vessels not over 200 tons burden may be safely moored waingaroa however is the only real good harbour it is commodious it is quite land-locked and has deep water close to the beach this i was told by the master of a vessel who had often been there for i had not time to visit it myself unfortunately i understand the land in its vicinity is swampy and there is no timber near from the abundance of quartz and other indications similar to what i have observed at otago i have little doubt that gold will be found at the chatham islands and i am confirmed in this impression by the opinion of a gentleman in wellington of acknowledged authority in such matters to whom i showed specimens of the rocks that i brought back with me altogether it must appear from what i have stated above respecting the soil climate and productions of the chatham islands that they are admirablysuited for settlement and occupation by europeans yet it is doubtful i think whether settlers without some special advantages being granted to them could be induced to go there while so much land yet remains open for selection in new zealand where already great facilities exist in the shape of good roads and steam communication for the conveyance of farm produce to the nearest market besides the numerous other advantages of being located at no great distance from large and thriving towns the centres of commerce and civilisation under all circumstances i cannot help remarking that these islands impressed me as being most admirably suited for the location of a penal establishment for this colony more than anything else distant from new zealand at the nearest point about 400 miles their insular position alone would ensure the security of the prisoners whilst with the advantages of possessing a good harbour temperate climate rich soil and abundance of stock such an establishment ought in a short time to be made entirely self-supporting from the labour of the convicts alone i know it may be objected that the presence of convicts would have a demoralizing influence on the present inhabitants but the place is of sufficient size to allow a large number to be kept in a locality quite apart from the natives and even if they were occasionally to meet i do not think worse consequences would result to the natives than must already have followed from the bad examples of the lawless and dissolute characters who have from time to time been left on shore from whaling ships especially as prisoners would always be under strict surveillance and control and putting aside altogether the question of the relative expense i do not think the location of convicts at the chatham islands can be looked upon as nearly so objectionable as would be the formation of a large establishment for them in the midst of any of the populous and rising settlements of new zealand i have c william seed land surveyor

conversant with the spot are of opinion that the terraces can hardly have escaped damage and most probably have totally disappeared the news of the eruption caused the greatest excitement iv town and the publication of extras was anxiously awaited the officer in charge of the napier telegraph station wires following received from rotorua man just arrived from te ngae reports three poles down about six miles north of here says the whole road and country round covered with blue mud 3ft deep at wairoa it is 10ft deep the houses are all buried up to the eaves a detailed account from tauranga a gentleman who left rotorua telegraphs from tauranga a cireaatul night has just been experienced every man woman and child thought their end had come the sensation was fearful and indescribable it commenced about 1 oclock this morning by several severe shocks of earthquake the vibrations were strong and frequent the windows in the houses rattled violently the feeling being similar to that on board of a vessel in a storm when the vibration of the earth was first felt people got up out of their beds thinking a spring of some sort had broken out close to their dwellings and after about outside to discover the cause it became clear that some wonderful element was unusually disturbed people were running about frantically when all at once a great roar was heard which was accepted at first as that of au earthquake and a great glare appeared on the horizon the scene was grand but awful towards rotomahana the flames were distinct with huge volumes of smoke with sparks of electricity illuminating the whole sky and it appeared as if hundreds of bright stars were chasing one another when this was at first seen by those who were outside they rushed about calling people up males and females of all ages left their homes and a general rush was made for ngatata mountain for safety many left their houses in their nightdresses with shawls round them mothers carrying their babies or young chileren with but one aim to flee from this devouring element which was expected every moment to engulf the entire community so great was the terror of the people this was about 2 am the night was wet and dark and the road in a muddy state on reaching the schoolhouse which is on the road major clarke was on the wayside and advised the women to go inside and take shelter as they were as likely to be as safe there as any part they might reach many of them accepted the invitation and were made very comfortable by mrs clark and family but others refused and hastened on to get as far away as possible some are supposed to have gone intending to reach taurauga or cambridge oa the approach of daylight this morning the vibrations lessened but they by no means ceased and many who had gone about seven miles from nere returned about 4 oclock there was a shower of ashes similar to sand supposed to be lava judge clarke conducted divine service during the night in mrs morrison hotel the maoris did not rush so frantically about as did the europeans comparatively few of the former left the settlement it is not known yet where the disturbance is but it is supposed to be a volcano that has broken out somewhere about rotomahaua there has been no communication yet with wairoa but many have gone out to therefrom here to see if any assistance can be rendered to the people should danger have overtaken them as they are nearer to the supposed volcano rotorua lake has risen considerably and many of the springs are very disturbed and fresh one have broken the thunder still roars and the horizon in the east is black with smoke the sun is invisible and now at nine oclock the lamps are burning in the telegraph office with the sky clear to the westward thei people are discussing the dreadful ordeal which 7 u they have experienced but confidence is being jj restored the stores are closed and work is at i standstill no one feeling inclined to do anything how to get away from rotorua is exercising the minds of many and some are arranging to take their departure at once two buggies have just returned from wairoa with some of the iuhabitants who report the place as beiug destroyed with lava tarawera mountain has broken out into a volcano throwing lava down upon te wairoa six miles away smothering mrae hotel and other houses mr and mrs hazard and three children aresaid to belost also many natives mr mrae and his servants have escaped but one tourist named bambridge is reported missing mr mrae conduct during the lime is spoken off with the highest praise he had called every one in his house before going out had he not done so many more would have been lost those who have come in from wairoa are females and they present a sad appearance looking pale and giooruy their dresses being smeared with lava no doubt the terraces will be destroyed how the whole thing will finish and when is quite perplexing since the intelligence has reached here regarding te wairoa the excitement is very great an account from napier napier june 10 a special correspondent at taupo sends the following to the hawke bay herald as far as we can learn here three seemingly extinct volcanoes near wairoa lake tarawera called reniwahea tarawera and naihanga suddenly burst into eruption this morning about 215 sending numerous showers of mud and throwing lava and hurling large burning rocks around to considerable distances the shocks were very severe at rotorua inhabitants and visitors were greatly alarmed and many left at once for oxford messengers who were despatched from rotorua to the scene have returned and report great loss of life only two of mr hazard family being known as yet to have escaped the school and teacher house are completely submerged meae hotel and other houses at wairoa are all destroyed the dead bodies of fourteen natives have been found but it is feared that many native settlements along the line of eruptions are destroyed if the wind changes to the east it is also feared that rotorua will suffer we have not heard from there since 10 am up to which time the eruptions were going on but we can still hear occasionally rumblings indicating that the volcanoes are still active as seen from here the first intimation was a continuous rumbliug followed by a sharp report a largo ball of fire was seen to bt ejected to an immense height and to burst sending out a shower of sparks and dense volumes of smoke this was followed by a uloud rising above our horizon in mushroom shape densely thick on the top and lighter towards the horizon scintillating and sending out sparks of apparently electric matter in every direction the lower part occasionally opened intoflaiiebutthewhole mass was mi incessant fire up to 5 am we had about a dozen shocks of earthquake at the beginning very slight but much sharper towards the end the morning was piercing cold with clear starlight except the one cloud over tarawera which spread gradually to the eastward it was perfectly calm to about 4 oclock an auckland account auckland june 10 last night constant explosions were heard iv auckland which were thought to proceed from the direction of the manukau as the sounds were like distress signals it was thought a war vessel had gone ashore ou manukau bar the eveuing star despatched a special reporter to make inquiries but he discovered no trace of any vessel iv distress on the coast the cause of the explosions is found to be that during last night a tremendous outburst of volcanic activity occurred in the rotorua district surpassing anything hitherto experienced in new zealand violent eruptions took place accompanied by loud reverberations and explosions the people are fleeing the district but know not where to turn as the whole country from lake taupo to tauranga is covered with thick smoke dark as midnight maoris and europeans are rushing about iv great excitement and property of all kinds is completely destroyed the flashes of fire were plainly visible from auckland and suburbs proving the gigantic nature of the eruptions the mayor of auckland has received a telegram from the mayor of taurauga asking for steamers to take of the residents private telegrams state that tauranga was iv total darkness at nine oclock this morning the town is covered with ashes the mayor has replied that he will assist to the best of his ability vibrations of earthquake aro felt in auckland and fissures observed in response to the appeals from tauranga the ss wellington left in the afternoon to take off the refugees a tauranga telegram says the panic is increasing and everbody is anxious to leave an account from gisborne grisbosne june 10 at 230 this morning the inhabitants of gisborne were startled out of their sleep by a rumbling noise accompanied by shocks causing houses to shake and windows rattle as there seemed no likelihoood of the phenomenon stopping a number of people got up and paraded the town in a state of excitement their attention was attracted in the direction of rotorua from west to west south-west by volumes of fire shooting up in the air out of an umbrella-shaped cloud the sight was a magnificent one the cloud spread out over th whol tky and tha tumbling continued until nearly four this morning when there was a sharp shock of earthquake followed quickly by a second and at eight another slight shock the town up to the present is nearly in utter darkness and the shops are all lit up there is a distinct smell pervading the air which has a peculiar effect ou many inhabitants it is supposed to be a volcano in the direction of rotorua the affair has caused great excitement birds this mornln are flying about in a helpless fashion up to j60 the night was clear but intensely cold at present it is raining heavily latest kiom auckland auckland june 10 the first outbreak of the eruption at wairoa occurred at 2 oclock when a tremendous explosion broke out right in the middle of the town the people all rushed out of their houses and the guests living in the hotels ran out into the roadway in their nightdresses there was an immediate stampede for horses and every vehicle was put into requisition the people made all haste to clear out jito tauranga and cambridge great fears are felt for the people at te wairoa as they are right in the centre of the eruption the whole country is covered with ashes the telegraphist says he will stick to the instrument as long as possible he has sent his family away for safety the following further telegrams have been received rotorua 11 am the telegraph operator was compelled to flee for his life and left his instrument the line inspector met him and the two thinking the volcanic showers had lulled turned back and are determined to stick to their post as long as possible there is intense excitement the people are leaving here for tauranga since midnight mr benner postmaster at maketu reports that the atmospheric disturbances caused a darkness there until 10 am the earthquakes lasted from half-past 2 am till a quarter-past 8 with very strong lightning and earth currents the office has not suffered any damage thunder and lightning with a sharp earthquake occurred from half-past 3to half-past 11 am to-day about 5 a fine dust fell and at about 8 oclock pumice of pearl barley size the dust is still 1250 falling it was pitch dark till a quarter to 10 am there is still a haze and a depth of dust deposite of over an inch there is fearful news of the loss of life at wairoa rotomahana is reported to have broken out into one active volcano the latest is that the terraces have all gone 26 bodies have been recovered description of the country the following information regarding the eruption has beea supplied by members of parliament conversant with th3 district affected tarawera mountain the scene of the volcanic eruption lies north and south rising from the south end of taraweralake two miles from rotomahana it is about 2800 ft high with three table tops separated by two extinct craters the formation of which is beyond the memory of man its surface of bare volcanic rock contained no vegetation the natives living near the spot have carried their dead to the top where thousands of skeletons layexposeda sort of town of silence the spot was very tapu and the maoris have always held that any stranger going there would bring about a storm they will probably now attribute the eruption to this cause although there are or were two craters on the top of the mountain there has been no eruption within the memory of man and the maoris had no tradition whatever respecting this mountain though there are innumerable traditions respecting other eruptions inthe north mount tarawera is about 10 miles from the settlement of te wairoa village which lies between ratakakahi lake and tarawera lake about 200 ft above the latter connected by the wairoa stream two years ago ratakakahi lake which is about three miles in length rose t nearly boiling point this was considered a most remarkable phenomenon as the lake was always cold before there was also a very strong outflow down the wairoa valley into tarawera lake lasting fora day since then ratakakahi had remained in its normalstate it may here be metioned incidentally that according to maori tradition tarawera was the home of the last moa in the north island the toubouraugi tribe numbering about 200 natives lived at te wairoa which settlement contained a number of substantial wooden buildings occupied by europeans and maoris there were in addition two capital hotels for theeonvenienee of tourists three stores a hall and an episcopalian church mr hazard who with several of his family was killed by the eruption was schoolmaster his family were a most interesting one and highly esteemed alike by europeins and maoris there were seven sons and daughters most of whom have unhappily perished mrs hazard and her two grown-up daughters took an active interest inthe welfare of the native children and the conduct of the school which was the most successful native school in new zealand mr hazard had been occupied as a teacher in the district for about seven years and was about 50 years of age from the scene of the eruption to tauranga as the crow flies is about 55 miles and taupo 50 miles the distance to gisborne is 120 miles and to opotiki 60 miles rotorua is situated 10 miles from wairoa and about 20 from taraweramount te wairoa is a village where coaches with tourists for the terraces stay wbakatereor white island has recently been noticed to be in violent eruption and the workmen employed in obtaining sulphur from that island have been unable to work there owing to the great activity of the crater and vessels have been unable to efieet a landing as stones and debris have been hurled thousands of feet into the air while clouds of red volcanic dust have enveloped the islet whakatere is the northern terminal of the volcanic zone and tongariro 150 miles distant is the southern terminal the width of the zone it about 40 miles and between the two termini there are innumerable geysers mud volcanoes and boiling water holes tongariro was remarkably active on the 6th july 1871 at which time flames were seen issuing from the crater and violent explosions were heard as far as tauranga it is worthy of note that for the last few weeks the hot water at rotorua has been failing in a manner quite unknown previously the only eruption in hot lake district which caused a loss of life is said to have occurred about 120 years ago when portion of ohinemutupab called uruika was submerged in the lake which was boiling on that occasion about thirty natives were scalded to death it is feared that the pink and white terraces of rotomahana will be destroyed the government have sent instructions to inspector goodall at the thames to proceed at once to the scene of the eruption and investigate matters as closely as possible the maori meaning of tarawera is burning peak some particulars regarding the locality so far as can be ascertained mount tarawera has not been in eruption beforeor at least within the knowledge of the maoris who are supposed to have inhabited the colony ahout 500 years the volcanic formation of the north island is divided by dr hochstetter in his work into throe zonesnamely that of taupo which contains the grandest and rarest volcanic phenomena that new zealand can boast and the auckland and bay of island zones the centre of the taupo volcanic zone in which is included mount tarawera extends from white island in the bay of plenty to rotorua and includes the whole of the lakes district the natives living in the vicinity or tarawera taupo tongariro and ruapehu have innumer able legends regarding these notable places an d many of these are quoted by dr hochstetter in his work on new zealand perhaps the best description of wairoa obtainable is that given in maoriland the illustrated handbook published by the union company and we make the following extracts from that work wairoa the settlement of wairoa has seen many vicissitudes during the last forty years it was in 1845 that the veteran missionary the rev g m spencer first took up mission work amongst the natives of the district at kariri galilee a strongly fortified settlement of wairoa where with the assistance of an old carpenter he put up the parsonage utilising for the purpose the best of the rimu tmber which had been killed by the maori cultivation fires the native school at wairoa has been for the last seven years under the management of mr c a hazard who expresses himself in hopeful terms of the good wrought amongst the native population by the native schools there are at present over 60 children on the roll many of whom come a considerable distance to attend school tabawbba a path that diverges to the left from the gate of the church enclosure leads out again on to the main rain road which runs from the hotels to the shores of the lake by crossing this road and mounting over a stilethe approach to a native wuareone reaches the brow of the hill looking down on tarawera from which point undoubtedly the best view of the lake is to be obtained there it stretches away below from the cluster of boat-houses where the wairoa joins it winding at first in a narrow bed between high wooded banks here rounding a promontory there receding into a bay and at last expanding into a wide sea bounded in the far distance by fern-covered hills or cliffs feathered to the ed4 of the lake with clumps of massive foliage th huge buttresses of the hills run sloping down to the water breaking the shore into numerous bays and concealing from the eye long reaches of the lake this splendid sheet is changeable in expression as the human face whenall is clear overhead the lake shimmers and glistens in the sunlight or reflects from its motionless depths the cloud fleck blue of the skies every breath of wind sets the surface dimpling into a thousand ripples and the tiny wavelets break upon the shore or on the outstanding boulders with a gentle lapping cadence very pleasant to the ear if clouds float in the sky they play upon the surface of the lake as cloud chases cloud is like the play of the wind on a barley-field inclose and sultry weather when the clouds hang low the water still responding to the influence of sky and air takes on a leaden colour and becomes dull piacid and heavy jjarge tracts smooth and unctuous like a surface of oil are curiously broken by ruffled patches which for no perceptible reason quiver and shiver as if with some agitation beneath in this smooth state the water gives back very perfect reflections of objects on its banks or floating on its surface about half way along the southern shore of lake tarawera the lakeshoots towards the south in a long narrow arm called te ariki and it is down this bay that the boat turns to make for rotomahana but whilst rowing in the main body of the lake this arm is concealed from view by spur which slopes down towards the water and terminating in sharp cape forms the western head of the bay on the left rises the remarkable mouut tarawera its three summits tarawera ruawahia and wahanga rising to a height of neatly 2000 ft there is a strange fascination about this curious truncated mountain it looks bare and scarred its steep walls rising up black and terrible as if blasted with lightningthe very sublimity of desolation no wouder that the maori imagination invests this spot with a sacred horror it is to them a city of the dead and may not lightly be approached and when clouds gather round its summit and roll in heavy masses along its sides driven by the fierce winds that play about the crest it requires no active imagination to people it with weird and spiritual terrors opposite the mountain on the right side of the te ariki arm is a remarkable hill readily recognised as

its shores are rugged and rocky and steep its waters deeply and darkly blue the lake extends some seven or eight miles lengthwise and is five or six miles in breadth the three flat cones of tarawera

tarawera outlet awa o te atua river of the gods past edgcumbe and away on to the bay of plenty at some distance from its source the river forms a magnificent waterfall about a year ago the water in tarawera suddenly changed colour and became nauseous and unwholesome there was some corresponding disturbance on rotokakahi too and the creek between rose rapidly to such a height that the natives were alarmed and apprehensive of a flood they swarmed up the hills and waited till they subsided again tarawera water remained unusable for nearly a year its colour during that space being of a dirty green then it changed to perfect purity again and is now quite available for drinking purposes the experience of other districts at wanganui trie sounds of the volcanic eruptions were heard distinctly between 2 and 4 the police thought a vessel was in distress and went out to ascertain some country residents say the glare could be seen at new plymouth curious noises like explosions or the firing of a man-of-war guns at sea were heard about 3 in the morning lasting over an hour at napier at 230 am an earthquake was felt and from that hour a long rumbling broken-by explosions us from the heaviest artillry continued till daylight the utmost alarm was manifested by many who feared a coining earthquake or that dreadful disaster had occurred in the interior of the island loud reports like gun-firing were heard in blenheim pieton and other places further south between 3 and 4 in the morning and were supposed te be distress signals from a ship in cloudy bay the reports were accompanied by reverberation and the rattling of windows at ciiristchurcb a good many persons who were about heard some explosions which they were much puzzled at at dunedin at four oclock yesterday morning the fire alarm signals at the dunedin brigade station started off and continued intermittently in motion uiitil a quarter past seven oclock in consequence of this superintendentrobertson was as may be imagined somewhat disturbed in mind and yesterday an inspection of all the alarm-boxes in the city was made these were however intact and it was pretty certain that cause of this apparently strange occurrence may be attributed to the volcanic eruption in the north island official intelligence wellington june 10 the native minister has received a telegram o the effect that the house of hazard

fboji oub own correspondent wellington june 10 there is little fresh information to-night about the tarawera eruption a rumour was flying about the house at 11 pm that some member had received a telegram announcing three violent shocks of earthquake and a revival of eruptions in enhanced force but after an hour diligent inquiry i am unable to discover any ground for the report the government despatched the hiuemoa early this evening for taurauga dr hector with two assistants has gone by her to inspect the locality and report the results of the outbreak and the surveyorgeneral has instructed mr percy smith chief surveyor of auckland to proceed to the spot and make his report as to the scientific aspect of the case there are all sorts of discrepant theories one is that owing to the exceedingly dry summer the ground has become deeply fissured permitting the access of water to the subterranean fires thus leading to the violent explosion but this is of doubtful value another theory is that this outbreak is due to the sudden extinction of volcanic energy at kilauea sandwich islands reported recently but the subject of volcanic action is involved in mystery and at present the particulars available are insufficient to enable any of our savants t theorise conclusively as to cause and i may state for the benefit of southern readers that mount tarawera fills up the background of the shore of the lake bearing the same name it is described as a high sloping terrace from which spring three peaks that to the left being a perfect truncated cone rising to the height of nearly 3000 feet above the sea level and named te wheiga the middle cone ruawhia is jabout the same height and that ou the right is tarawera three or four hundred feet lower and sloping southward these two latter are reported in active eruption ruawhia is used as a resting place for the remains of the dead manyhundreds of skeletons being deposited there as on the indian towers of silence the triple-headed mountain overlooks rotomahana as well as tarawera lakes at the foot of tarawera is a remarkable cone which is said to have been an active volcano within the limits of maori tradition

ofcago daily times when sir julius vogel was editor he subsequently took charge of this native school he was about 60 years of age and a staunch blueribbonist an incident at ohenemutu to the editor sikas anything however remotely connected with the violent convulsions which have just occurred in the volcanic region between taurauga and lake taupo possesses some interest for the public at this moment i may mention an incident which happened at ohinemutu on the shores of lake rotorua on the 20th ult i arrived there on the 21st and went to the palace hotel which is situate at the junction of the main street running through the village and the road which leads thence to wairoa a tourist staying atthe hotel informed me that on the 20th a geyser had suddenly burst up in the middle of the wairoa road within fifty yards of the hoteljand risen to the height of about 12 feet arid continued spouting boiling mtid for saino hours after which it hattsubsided to the road iiivel lat once went with him to the spot and there saw a small tumulus of mud which was theu gently bubbling and steaming the wairoa road is skirted near the hotel by a ravine covered with dense manuka scrub from whence volumes of steam are constantly emitted by numerous ngawhas or boiling springs but until the incident above mentioned thesite of the hotel had been considered exempt from the danger of such eruptions as i saw no reason why a similar eruption of greater force and volume might not take place right under the hotel at dead ofnighfc and engulf its inmates in scalding mud you may imagine that such an apprehension was somewhat alarming to a stranger at first but as the people about the hotel appeared to regard the occurrence with indifference it gradually ceased to trouble me except when i happened to wake in the night and then i confess the thought of oeing suddenly hoist by a boiling mud geyser caused me a bad quarter of an hour there can now be little doubt that the breaking out of that mud geyser in a place which from time immemorial had been free from such eruptions was a premonitory signal of the more violent volcanic convulsions which have since taken placel am c viator june 10 at a

latest figures in mr hayter year book with regard to the australian food supply let us now throw some further light upon this subject by turning to the figures relating to the distribution of the population in australia it is well known that an immense proportion thereof is not engagedin producing food at all if we inspect mr hayter table of the occupations of the people we find that aot 15 per cent are engaged either iii agricultural or pastoral pursuits while the great iuik ortneni arecrowaeci into four towns the story is an old one but it will bear repetition estimated estimated colony population capital population in 1877 in 1887 victoria 1036119 melbourne 391546 ats wales 1042919 sydney 348695 queensland j 366940 brisbane 55475 s australia 312758 adelaide 111300 the colonial office list gives brisbane and suburbs 73679 further the population of these towns has a tendency to increase out of all proportion to that of the rest of the colony eg lifcrkasb in population between 1881 and 1889 victoria 173773 melbourne 108 599 ns wales 391451 sydney 124 484 south australia 32550 adelaide 7436 queensland 153415 brisbane 24 356 651195 264875 so far as regards queensland the figures are not so unfavourable though the increase in brisbane is 80 per cent as against 71 per cent for the whole colony in south australia again the increase of the adelaide population is less in proportion than that of the country but the total population of south australia is estimated to have decreased slightly since 1886 and it is more than probable that this colony has helped to swell the numbers in sydney and melbourne as regards this last pair the figures are astounding though melbourne is the worse case of the two the proportion that the population of melbourne bore to that of victoria was 2089 per cent 2887 per cent 32-81 per cent 38-40 per cent hayter vol i p 79 between the censuses of 1871 and 1881 the population of greater mel bourne increased by considerably more than a third that of the country districts by considerably more than a sixth but the popula tion of the extra metropolitan towns fell off by 1-40 ibid p 78 finally if we sum up the metropolitan populations of australia including perth we find that out of a total of roughly 2900000 souls no fewer than 913500 are congregated in five towns and if we add the three towns of ballarat 40000 sandhurst 36000 and geelong 20740 we find the town population of australia raised to over a millionthat is to say to well over one-third of the whole but it may be said surely the australians understand their own business agriculture is hazardous work in most parts of the continent and pastoral occupations from the nature of the case employ relatively speaking only a few hands the australians have coal and iron and wool why should they not work up their own produce and become a manufacturing population increasing to any number that can find employment 1 by all means we reply bufc how is this large manufacturing population to be fed is it to import its food if so from whence from new zealand is the natural reply and no doubt new zealand should become the granary of australia hut it is not to be supposed that australia will ever rely entirely upon new jjeaiand and the ultimate issue must be unproved cultivation in australia itself but here we are confronted with the old difficulty dearth of water then it will be rejoined water must be stored now what has been done in australia so far in the way of water storage 1 every one of the colonies is more or less heavily burdened with debt incurred in 1861 1871 isbi 1887 more or less for y the development of its resources but we find that of a total of 1111 millions some 10 millions odd or about 9-25 per cent only was contracted for purposes of water storage and in this sum is included the expenditure on sewerage of course the greater part of these ten millions was taken simply to supply the overgrown towns of sydney melbourne and adelaide victoria to her credit be it said has been the foremost in grappling with this vital question of water storage and notably so during the last few years but it remains to be seen whether the vaiious experiments especially that under the management of the brothers ohaffey will be successful mr hayter tells us little on the point but we quote what he says the scale on which irrigation has been practised in victoria up to the present time is too small to admit of comparisons between results obtained from land which has and which has not been irrigated being of much value and as in the year to which the figures relate there was an abundant supply of rain in most of the shires in which irrigation was practised its bene ficial results were apparent in the case of a few only of the crops indeed in some cases it appears to have been positively injurious and it is stated that in the swan hill dis trict a number of the irrigated crops were destroyed by rain flood and rust the only crops grown on irri gated land which gave better returns than those on land which had not been irrigated were potatoes mangel wurzel and grapesvol 11 p 219 it would appear then that in seasons favourable to unirrigated land the irrigated land is liable to damage by flood and accordingly we find that in victoria the number of acres subjected to irrigation after rising from 6935 in 18834 to l 21342 in 1886-7 fell in 1887-8 to l 8993 vol 11 p 22 rankin deals with the whole question of irrigation in an extremely summary fashion saying in effect that there is not water enough nor nearly enough of late however we have heard much of the tapping of underground rivers and although the water obtained from such borings is generally unfit for human consumption yet these underground supplies may possibly do much for australia this however remains yet to be seen we published on friday morning-a telegraphic abstract of a memorandum by the department of justice re the tarras fire the memorandum in question is explanatory of the action of the department in refusing to authorise an inquiry into the proceedings at the inquest which took place after the fire it disposes sof the statement that no notice was taken of the petition signed by 280 electors by showing that the petition was addressed to the member for the district the hon t fergus for presentation to parliament and that it will be so presented next session it is also exculpatory of the implied charge which was contained in the statement that during the inquest which lasted four days the coroner the inspector of police the solicitor retained by mr stronach and the foreman of the jury shared the hospitality of mr stronach the manager of the station which had sustained the loss by the burning of the stacks mr stronach and mr mkenzie not being on good terms the scene of the inquest was remote from settlement being 20 miles from the nearest town cromwell obviously it would have been impossible for those who took part in it to have made cromwell their headquarters but nevertheless the relation of the parties lays them open to mis-maot-otoii tile jnemuriiauilr xuhimr states that the coroner had no power to refuse to receive the rider because any jury has the power to bring in one if it chooses we suppose everybody knew that although it is given to very few to know what becomes of the riders unless they are express directions to bring some circumstance under notice but this particular rider was different to most other riders in several ways in the first place it names the persons against whom the suspicion was directed the following is the wording of the verdict with the rider that some person or persons to the jurors unknown feloniously wilfully and maliciously did set fire to the said six stacks of cornthe property of rthe said dalgety and co on the morning of the 22nd day of april last at tarras freehold with intent then and there to injure that grave suspicion lays to james mkenzie farmer at tarras also to john beaton mkenzie his hired servant and that every care and precaution has been displayed by mr john stronach manager of tarras station against fire evidently the jury were under the impression that the mkenzies had committed arson but thought they had not sufficient evidence before them to prove it their clear duty in that case was either to return a verdict inculpating some perr son or persons unknown or if they thought there was evidence against the i mkenzies sufficient to justify further in quiry then they should have brought in 1 a verdict of arson against them they ought to have been set right on this point by the coroner the rider is in reality the verdict but it operates with out giving the mkenzies the opportunity of rebutting it and it is for this that they should have the opportunity which an inquiry would give furthermore when the statement as to the manner of conducting the inqaest is considered the grounds for an j inquiry seem strong mr mkenzie says in his letter that he was first examined by the inspector of police cross-examined by the solicitor and then re-examined by the inspector he was recalled on the last day and again examined and cross-examined and his man the other mkenzie was treated in exactly a similar way they were evidently suspected and if his statement be true it was sought to obtain such evidence from them as would either confirm suspicion or remove it practically they were in custody because they attended under subpoena and the police were present and they would certainly have been arrested at once had the verdict incriminated them therefore their treatment was repugnant to the well-known principle that no one shall be asked to give evidence against himself we are not now pronouncing on mkenzie innocence or guilt and we quite agree with the dictum of the memorandum that it could not be entertained for a moment that every person whose character is assailed in a court should go to government and obtain a commission at the public expense to clear him but the principles of fair play upon which the law is based must be observed and the minister memorandum has not shown that the mkenzies received that fair play the rms ruapehu with the inward english mails to april 6 arrived at wellington yesterday the rms alatneda with the inward mails via

returned by the coroner jury that investigated the circumstances attending the death of mr pelham jones who sustained fatal injuries when riding in the ijurdle race on the jueenfs pirthday it appeared from the evidence that the horse of the deceased was the last to take the hurdle at which he fell so that no one in the race could in the smallest degree have contributed to the apqident a deal of excitement was occasioned at the tongue wharf yesterday morning when a man named james johnston a resident of timaru who was in an intoxicated state fell between the steamer centennial and the wharf into the water a rush was at once made for the spot and a rope was lowered but it was sometime before the roan realised that he was expected to hold on to the rope like grim death until he was safe on the wharf at last a suspicion of this dawned on his dimmed faculties he grasped the rope and willing hands soon pulled him to a place of safety when a constable took him in charge and escorted him clear of the crowd a three-roomed house in de carle street st kilda was destroyed by fire at about 8 oclock on saturday evening the house was owned by mr daniel hart who with his wife and family was

taupo writes to the new zealand herald two gentlemen who left here for ruanui mr studholme run and returned on the ist inst state that it was reported to them that a startling phenomenon had occurred in the whangaehu river which is of a milky colour very strongly impregnated with sulphur and quite shallow this river which takes its source from the eastern side of ruapehu and empties itself between wanganui and turakina usually so quiet suddenly burst forth on the 22nd april from the mountain and in 10 minutes time became a swollen raging torrent bank-high and of inky blackness there had been no rain to cause such a flood and which came solely from its source the mountain there has been no such outbreak previously in the memory of natives or europeans who live near its locality and it is a source of wonder and amazement to them possibly the cessation of steam from the hot lake on the top of ruapehu reported a short time since may have had something to do with it who can tell here is a nut for scientists or hectorites to crack if they can mr j e grace who happened to be mustering sheep on the kaimanawa range which is opposite to ruapehu on the above date states that he saw an immense column of steam ascending high in the air which lasted for about half an hour and then disappeared he thought if at thetime most extraordinary as he had lived in the district a great many years and never saw such a sight before rabbiters in the awatore and surrounding districts says the marlborough press are now we are informed earning at the rate of 1 per day but despite this

had apparently wholly misunderstood the evidence adduced the gist of the libel was an imputation on a married woman and a solicitor with whom she had had immoral relations that they conspired together to get the husband of the former put into a lunatic asylum with a view of getting his money and securing undisturbed freedom in their guilty courses this the husband had alleged in a former trial but had not attempted to prove his counsel in fact ignoring the charges which were not in any way sought to be sustained the judge left it to the jury to say whether the words complained of were within the bounds of fair criticism and after 20 minutes deliberation they returned a verdict for the plaintiff with 1000 damages the verdict being receiyed with symptoms of applause which were suppressed

has been before the1 public for some considerable time it will be remembered that the farmers of lower waipori instituted proceedings in the supreme court in 1893 against the jutland hat dredging company mr justice wilmams delivered judgment in the case in august of that yqar awarding damages against the company and granting the appellants an injunction restraining the company from polluting the waipori river by carrying on dredging operations the aid of the minister for mines was called in and an estimate of the compensation required by the riparian landowners arrived at it was estimated that the whole of the landowners could be compensated for a sum of 5800 but as a matter of fact the opposition of the landowners of the lower waipori district was withdrawn on the payment of a much less amount but that did not end the matter as the meeting at henley amply demonstrates and when the farmers of the taieri plain come to bo dealt with a much more formidable question will have to be faced time was when the taieri was a beautiful clear river with a channel deep enough tej allow sailing craft from dunedin to navigate it half-way up to allanton at that time there was also a fair depth of water throughout the waipori lake but when the goldfields in the taieri and waipori basins were discovered a rapid change took place the erstwhile clear water became turgid and thesilting up-of lake and river have been in progress ever since the process has been a slow one and for some 30 years or so the public appeared to take no notice of it of recent years however the farmers on the low alluvial lands contiguous to the taieri and waipori rivers have awakened to the fact that the rivers are silting up to a dangerous extent and that the time has arrived when something will have to bo done to legaen that danger protective embankments have been constructed along the river side practically from outram to the confluence of the taieri and waihoia rivers these embankments serve the purpose of confining the river within its channel when a freshet occurs and vrhen it would otherwise-oveflow its banks and flood the plain but unfortunately as fast as the embankments can be raised the river bed is also rising from the deposition of the mining detritus sent into it from the gold wordings in op near its upper reaches the filling up of the river has been sq ser-jous tjiat ong resident of 29 years stated that the depth of water near his puce had been reduced in that time by lift that ino exaggeration 98 anygpe who hfis had an acquaintance with the river for apy length of time can state other evidence which has come under our notice corroborates that of mr mkegg the sanae experience applies to the lower reaches of the waiporj river and large areas of the waippri lake thajj were formerly water ways for boats are growing green with marsh vegeta j tien while the who qf ths lake hag shoaled tp such an extent as to render it unfit f of water traffic but the loss of water ways is the least of the ill effects resulting from the qijting up of the riyer rafppred tqi the dangftrin time ef heavy rain to the farmers is a far more serieujg lpir for some years past the basin of the taieri has not been visited by the prblqngecj and sgver-e paing whiphpaiec the damaging floods of former years but similar raips are certain to racvtp in years tg come apd when they do ths prepe pt river channel will be fovffld totally injadquate to erry pff the watgrp in time to avert a destructive fleod that is the danger whifih canfrpnts the farmers of the taieri plain and it is tp he regretted that the meeting at hejnley was not more unanimous on the question of establishing an extended river district with rating ppwers to undertake seme necessary wgrk to lessen the risk frem floods if the farmers calmly ftwait d6ylopments and trust to be compensated by the minister for mines for any damages that may oeour in time of flood they may find the process too tedious to follow up if on the other hand they show that they are willing to help themselyes no doubt they will be substantially siubsidisd by the mines department the controlling power of the induetrj which ig the chief caijae pf their present grievance by their own watjt of forethought the farmers of the taieri plain hay allowed the silting up of the rivers tp go on all these years without complaint and now when they find danger imminent they are urgent in their demand for government assistance to 4q aprae hing to olesin oit theriver channel the meeting at henley was unanimous in the opinion that the government should deal with1 this matter and the members for bruce and taieri will be asked tp endeavour to get a bill passed at the approaching session of parliament making provision for the setting up of a river district covering1 the whale area concepned in tfiig question as the law stands the riparian rights of the landowners are undoubted and they pan obtain redress by recoiuse to the law courts 5 but the raining industry is o equal importance to that of farming so that anything in the nature of cqinpromise would be better than litigation the government are tolerably certain tp grant the demands of the farmers of the tajeri plain provided always these demands are within reason the proposal to plaeadredge upon the rivers for the purpose of deepening the chaiinel appears z to be reasonable enough ml strvßtson who was chairman at the meeting said that a suitable dredge wouw cost j2700 and would require 411qq a yer to keep it going when the value of the interests at stake is taken into account the sums mentioned are not prohibitiveand in all probability the difficulty between the farmers and the miners will b adjusted by a government subsidy foif deepening the channels ef the taieri and waipori rivers by means of dredging one gentleman at the1 meeting expressed the opinion that all that was necessary was to strengthen the present banks and to trust to floods to scour out the channel a superficialyiew of-the matter might lead to the endorsement of that opinion but a closer acquaintance with the nature of the deposit which settles at the bottom of the taieri river excludes the idea of natural scouring the fine silt consolidates into a tenacious clay upon which the sluggish current of the river even when running bank-highhas very little effect the small amount d scour in tiiiie of flood is wholly insufficient to remove the accumulation of silt in the low river intervals dredging therefore appears to be the only means by which to stay the progress of what is becoming everyyear a greater danger the arbitration tconrb was again adjourned yesterday owing to the fact that his honor mr justice edwards was not sufficiently recovered for idtobaprudent that he

honorable the commiiaioec of customs i shall endeavour to notice each of the subjects to whicq my attention has been directed in the order in which they stand in the paiagraph quoted above h respecting the trade of the chatham islands i have to submit the following information whioh i gathered from various sources and believe to be correct prom the year 1841 to about 1854 four to six whaling ships generally visited the islands every year for supplies during the succeeding years 1855 to 1857 when potatoes were in such demand tor the australian market their visits became less frequent and for the last three years 858 3859 and 1860 they have principally touched at pitts lbland and piocuied supplies from the two europeans messis hunt and reignault resident there in 1860 the natives who up to that time had always resided on the main island found that vessels from australia ceased to arrive foi thejr potatoes and that the whaling ships visited the neighbouring island only so a number of them went across and established themselves there also so as to be able to obtain a share of the trade during that year i understand nine whaling ships called theie but as jnauy of them t am told purchased the supplies they lequhed for cash few dutiable articles weie landed fiom them however this may be certain it is that on tho main island i found with the exception of the tobacco as i said before no evidence of any quantity of dutiable goods having been landed there for some time the european residents had long been withouttoa svgai 1 and such like articles andthenatives i observed were becoming so badly off for clothing that the women were beginning to raako mats again an occupation that they had previously abandoned for years potatoes aro at present almost the only things grown laige orops of which aro raised year alter year fiom the same giound with very little labor it has been almost exclusively for the3e that the trade to the islands has hitheito been carried on veiy little wheat or grain of any kind has been laised inco the potatoes fiist began to realize such high prices one yeai the maoris were paid as much as six pounds 6 a ton for them by the traders from australia in 1854 about 2000 tons were shipped for sydney and melbourne in the piu chose of which it is estimated that the tiadeis spent about fivo thousand pounds 5000 in cash and as much more in goods altogether from 1854 to 1856 inclusive about seven thousand 7000 tons were exported and it was during that time that so many vessels vibited the islands and that a considerable tiade was carried on at present there is scarcely any sign among the natives of the piosperity they attained to in those yeaiy beyond tho number of horses which they possess as mobt of the money they lecehed for their produce was soon most foolishly dissipated in 1859 the whole jwtato crop about two thousand 2000 tons rotted in the ground for want of purchasers in is6o five vessels arrived fiom australia and took away about four hundred and fifty 450 tons and tlnee vessels from new zealand shipped about one bundled and fifty 150 tons more these all cost on an average three pounds 3 a ton so that last year about eighteen hundred pounds 1800 most pait in tiade was laid out on the islands the goods taken from new zealand were no doabt all duty paid at tho poits at which they were shipped in consequence of these few vessels calling last year the natives again made large plantations both maoris and euiopeans assured me that the crop for the present season would yield at least two thousand 2000 tons and from what i saw myself i believe this to be a low estimate at waitangi alone theie were at least two hundred 200 tons of the finest potatoes i ever saw brought into the pah to bo leady for shipment with the exception of one hundred aud sixty 150 tons shipped for wellington all this large ciop like that of 1559 must lot on the ground the esther has been the only vessel that has called to load this year in the thiee trips she has made there have been shipped seven hundicd and thiity-two 732 bushels of wheat one bundled and sixty-two 102 tons of potatoes and about twelve hundred pounds of wool the cost of this would be about tlnee hundied and fifty pounds 350 and moie than two-thirds of this was paid for in goods duty paid in new zealand the natives this 3earhave been glad to take one pound 1 a ton for their potatoes deliveied on boaid the vessel the piice of wheat has been four shillings 45 a bushel in formei jeais theie weie several whaling stations on the main island and last year the maoris had some boats out and obtained a few tuns of oil but this euterpnse has now altogether ceased the eurodcui population of the chatham islands is now very small beyond the three geiman settlers and their families and mr shand and family on the main island aud the families of messrs hunt and reignault on pitts island there aie not a dozen otheis altogether and most of these live among the maories and cultivate small plots of ground or taupas in common with them i enclose a return which shows the total number to be foity-six only viz thhty-thice adults and thirteen childien i found gieat difficulty at first in my endeavoma to asceitain the pieseut number of maories and aborigines all the estimates both by natives and euiopeaus differed veiy widely shortly after my arrival however a laige number of natives assembled at kaiugaioa to tee me aud i took some pains to induce them to make a complete list of the names of all the native inhabitants of the diffeient settlements round the island in this i succeeded and lieheve the list i procured of which i beg to enclose a copy to be perfectly couect as i had seveial oppoi tunities of testing its accuracy i enclose also an abstiact of this nominal list which shows the native population to be as follows aboriginal or morioris 160 maories 413 half-castes by european fathers 17 total 590 five hundred and ninety souls from this letuin it will be seen that the natives must be lapidly on the decliue as there are only sixty-four children to fic hundied aud nine adults at lcaingaioa and the adjacent kaingas which comprises about half of the population thirty-four neaily all adult have died since issg and seventeen only have been born in the same period several years ago the lord bishop of new zealand took a list similar to the one i obtained and then the natives i was told numbeifd over a thousand it would be interesting now to compaic the two lists so as to ascertain the exact rate of decrease it should be noted that in addition to those who have died about thirty left for taranaki by the esthei in 1856 eveiywhere that i met the poor moiioiis i found them delight to see me but the maories appeared to exeicise a most suspicious vigilance over their actions and rarely left them a moment alone to talk to me the miseiable remuaut of this ill-used people i believe cling most tenaciously to the belief that his excellency government will ere long restoie them to freedom and to the possession of some portion of the land which was so cruelly wrested from them by their maori conquereis it is estimated that there must have been tlnee thousand aborigines on the island when the maoris first reached there twenty-five year 3 ago the gieater pait of these were slaughtered at once and the remainder subjected to a state of the most oppressive slavery of late years however their condition has much improved ibelievetheyaienotnowbeitenorill-used and they aro allowed to cultivate the ground for their own benefit in common with the maoris the men aiealso now allowed to take wives which they scrc not foimerly permitted to do but are still prohibited from incurving maori women only two instances have occuired of moriori men having taken maori wives and iv one of these the woman was formeily a slave in new zealand the maoris have a large number of horses theie must be nearly five hundred now on the island as upwards of a hundred principally breeding mares were brought down by the tiadeis from sydney in the years 185354 and 55 iheie must be also about a thousand head of oattle but most of these are running wild iv the bush i observed everywhere fine milch cows and working bullocks in excellent condition about the pah at tupuange the maoris have from eighty to a hundred sheep but of these they take sq little care that the dogs destioy them faster than they can increase the europeans have about thii teen hundred sheep which thrive pretty well half of these are on pittslsland and belong k tp mr hunt i legiot very much that i am not able to offer any couect estimate of the size of the islands or of the quantity of available land as i have never seen a chart of them and the short tinfe i was there i had little opportunity of gathering reliable information on these points nor had i an opportunity of visiting pitts island but persons who had been there describe it to be of small extent covered with bush throughout almost entirely steep hilly land with no good harbour and only two places where a landing oan be effected with any safety as to the lesouroes of the islands the best information i can supply i think will be a short description of the nature and quality of the soil and its productions in the centre of the main island which is nearly all low and undulating there is a urge suit water or brackish lake occupying fully one third of its area this lake has a hard sandy bottom and is easily fordable over about half of its extent where the mout i open at the point where its waters flow into the sea at times however after heavy gaes ftf wind i believe this is closed up and theft i is top deep to be crossed except in boats a ivgo portion of it is always very deep nearly all round the sea coast there is a belt of bush varying iv width from a inie ojj more dowu to one v or two hundred yard this portion the best land between it and the lake the ground is open and is coveied either with flax or with rushes low fern and a kind of heather the flax land is generally good the other is mostly very wet and swampy even on the highest parts but it could all be easily drained as it appears to be everywhere considerably above the level of the lake the soil throughout is light and rich and is composed principally of peat mixed with fine quartz sand varying in their proportions in different places in some parts near the sea coast the quartz sand entirely prevails forming long lines of sand-hills j in others the giounl is composed exclusively of peat in many places in the open ground this fine white quartz is so thickly strewn over the surface as to present the appeaiance of a recent fall of snow the bush land which is the only part that has yet been cultivated is the richest that i have ever seen it sustains a dense growth of vegetation and when cleat ed yields abundant crops of the samp kind for many years in succession wheat oats and barley have been cultivated with great success all the english fruit trees such as the apple pear peach plum and cherry c grow most luxmianlly iml bear well anything that is cultivated in the middle island of new zealand would do well i have no doubt at the chatluuu islands as the climate and tempeiature must be much alike the crops never suffer fiom di ought and no blight of any kind has yet made its appearance a change of seed wheat is much required as the soit the maories now have fimn want of proper caie and attention has much doteiiorated if a few bushels of leally good seed wheat and bailey could be sent down for distribution among the natives it would have a moot beneficial effect and would perhaps be the means of inducing them to cultivate more grain for which theie would always bo a steady demand at remunerative prices and they would then nofr have the moitification of seeing their whole year labour tin own away as is now the case in consequence of potatoes being the only crop cultivated for which as i have befoic pointed out there is no purchaser at all gient benefit woull also result from sending at the same lime some white clover seed which if only scattered over the abandoned maori cultivations would soon j rapidly spiead over the island besides converting these w asto places into eccllcnt pasturage at almost all the pahs theio are small patches of english grass which look rich and luxuriant but i did not see any clover the pi incipal oods are the karaka ake ake niatepo hoho and kaietnu i enclose a list of all the trees that

vessels not over two hundred 200 tons bin then may be safely mooied wangaroa however is the only really good harbour it is commodious it is quite land-locked and has deep water close to the beach this t was told by the master of a vessel who had been theie for i had not time to visit it mjself unfoitunately i understand the land in its vicinity is swampy and theie is no timber near fiom the abundance of quartz and other indications similar to what i have obseived at otago i have little doubt that gold will be found at the chatham islands and i am confirmed in this impression by the opinion of a gentleman in wellington of acknowledged authority in such matters to whom i showed specimens of the rocks that i brought back with me altogether it must appear from what i have stated above lespccting the soil clnnate and productions of the chatham islands that they are admirably suited for settlement and occupation by europeans yet it is doubtful i think whether scttleis without some special advantages being granted to them could be induced to go theie vhile so much land yet remains open for selection in new zealand vyhere already great facilities exist in the shape of good roads and steam communication foi the conveyance of farm produce to the nearest market besides the numerous other advantages of being located at no great distance from large and thriving towns the centies of commerce and civilization under all chcumstances i cannot help lemaildng that these islands impressed me as being most admirably suited for the location of a penal establishment for this colony more than anything else distant fioin new zealand at the nearest point about 440 miles their insular position alone would ensure tho security of the prisoners whilst with the advantages of possessing a good harbour tempeiate climate rich soil and abundance of stock such an establishment ought in a slioit time to be made entiiely self-suppoiting from the labour of the convicts alone i know it may be objected that the piesence of convicts ould have a demoralizing influence on the present inhabitants but the place is of sufficient size to allow a large number to be kept in a locality quite apait from the native and even if they vere occasionally to meet i do not think woise consequences would result to the natives than must have aheady followed fiom the bad examples of the lawless and dissolute chaiacteis who have from time to time been left on shoie fiom whaling ships especially as prisoners would always be under stiict surveillence and control and putting aside altogether the question of the lelative expense i do not think the location of convicts at the chatham islands can be looked upon as neatly so objectionable as would be the foimation of a large establishment for

assume a sevexe form vith a high mortalit it is unfortunate that the institution is so far from medical aid and he advises that it be put under supervision aud that a return be sent in periodically

gives our liner a hard struggle as she swings in to within a few feet of the rock wall rounding the point another rapid appears in sight a long wall of huge stonesslants down the river throwing the bulk of the waters over against the right bank the method of ascending the more difficult rapids is interesting to witness a wire rope is made fast to a snag or rock or tree at the head of the rapid the rope trails down the rapid and the lower end is secured to a buoy as the steamboat passes this buoy the rope is picked up from the bed of the river with a boat hook dragged on board a few turns passed round the spool of the winch steam is turned on and the boat hauls herself up the rapid assisted sometimes by three or four men vigorously poling after the manner of canoemen at the head of the rapid the rope is cast off and sinks again to the river bed and the boat glides away up the smooth reach above there are many curves and bends in the river ever and anon we seem to be about to butt into a gravel bank or knock a corner off new zealand or demolish an ill-fated native village or cripple ourselves but just as one of these things is about to happen the little boat spies a channel in

return from this disquisition to tie description of the maui maori tribes there was a great tribe known by the name of toi who before the canoes came from hawaiki and at that time occupied a large part of tv ika a maui extending from whakatane vwrtwarda i might mention toi in a general way as an ancestor over a very wide country but it is not in that sense that i use the name now i refer instead to the tnbe of toi proper whose country extended from whakataue to inland motu i would however observe first that though we have a hawaikian awa and an aboriginal awa also ilawaikian and aboriginal oho tribes we have no hawaikian toi tribe vi new zealand only the aboriginal toi is to be found in te ika a maui and yet in the genealoaies of each nation the names oi these three ancestors are found standing in the closest relationship at a time long neioro the passage of the canoes the mam toi lived nearly 200 years and the hawaiki toi 400 years before the migration 1 cannot tell how it is that these important names are common to the two nations it might be asked how was their language the same and how did it happen that they were of a similar appearance if w could answer these questions we should have the key to much besides a principal pa of toi was kami situated on the highest point of the whakatane hills as seen from the mouth of the river kokianga at ohiwa was a fishing station taavhitirahi overlooking kukumoa stream was a very strong pa another of their places was kohipaua east of the otara river and they had a settlement at to rotonuiawai at inland motu and doubtless they had kaingas and pas at intermediate places as already stated this people were of the aboriginal awa etock the head man at motu at a certain time wras tauwharanui he-lived at te rotontu wai near whakapaupakihi river it happened thata strange man came to his lcainga one day who said that his name was tarawa and that he was a god when asked how he claimed to be a god he said that he had swam across the ocean to this country and that no one unpossessed of supernatural power conld do that thinf then he remained at the kainga and married manawakaitu the daughter of tauwharangi by whom he had two children but tauwharanei failed to discern any divine attributes in hife son-ralaw and sceptically awaited an opportunity to prove his power by ocular demonstration at length a chance occurred and one night tarawa was awakened from sleep by water coming into his bed he arose to fmd a flood had suddenly covered the land and that all had fled his retreat was cut off and he had to climb to the top of his house and call for help to the others who knowing the local signs had avoided the danger and by their chiefs order had left him unwarned he was told to save himself he said he could not perform an impossibility lo but you can easily save yourself by your divine power it then came out that he was not a god at all and that they must send a canoe and save him which they did old tamvharangi was so digested that he thrust tarawa out of the kainga and told his daughter that if she wont with him she must leave thei children she departed witherarmlw bettledvferiihay jfft l i wlimlri vlfwof t mmiserehnliveai and diedand herethey leftafamily thathas now expanded into the important hapu of ngaitama of the whaka-tohea tribe this hapu is therefore of mixed aboriginal and immigrant blood for there is no doubt but that tarawa left one of the canoes during its passage along the coast as taritonngo left tainui at hawai and found his way to inland motu and like the woman torere who swam ashore from tainui at night as the canoe was passing taumata-apanm point also like some of the passengers by takitumu who left her en route and whose blood now flows in the veins of some of the principal chiefs inland of ohiwa and from whom the ngatira hapu of the whakatohea are partially descended from tauwharanui two grandchildren whom their parents had left with him when they went to motohora and from others no doubt of his hapu or family sprang the ttetincaliere another hapu of the whakatohea and in after times ngatipatu another hapu branched from the ngati egahere again when mataatua arrived at whakatone with ngatiawa immigrants from havaiki muriwai the old woman who headed the party had a son named repanga ftoih the top of whakatane range this man descried the smoke of the aborigirtes at kohipawa he returned to hjs mother told her what he had seen and obtained permission to visit the pepple arrived at kohipawa he was hospitably received by ranginui te kohu the chief of that place whose daughter ngapupereta he married from this source at kohipawa sprang ngaterua another hapu of the whakatohea being the fifth and last hapu of the great tribe of the whakatohea all of which are of mixed extraction three heing tinged with tainui strain one with ngatiawa and one with a takitumu connection we have seen that torere left tainm at tanmata apannithis she did to avoid the addresses of rakataura one of the crew arrived on shore she concealed herself in vilie hush in a valley the stream in which iears her name still the next morning when her flight was discovered rakataura landed and returning along the shore passed torereand taumata apanui searching in vain for the womap then he gave it up and turned and followed his companions by land whom he at length rejoined at kawhia torere joined affinity with the aborigines in that locality and ngaitai a tribe that takes its name from her canoe represents the union then formed and this tribe is acknowledged by tainui authority to be one that belongs to their own connection an interesting illustration of practical tradition is furiiished in connection with this ngaitai tribe although the tribe has a very ancient genealogical record extending some twelve generations back beyond the immigration from hawaiki and believed itself to be thoroughly rangatira yet it was unable satisfactorily to define its origin the question was raised to their humiliation during a boundary dispute by tho whakntohea in 1844 when rangimatazmkn chief of ngatirua speaking of the land in question and its ownership said to era the chief of ngaitai at a great meeting t opape tbati was convened oy my father in the hope to settle the dispute without bloodshed who are you i know the chiefs of ngatiawa and te uriwera the canoe they came in and how they obtained their possessions i know te whanau apanui who they are and how they occupy also i know whom we the whakatobea are but ido not know who you are tell me the name of your canoe challenged thus eru was compelled to say something in self-defence and replied we came in your canoe oh said ilangimatanuku v you came in my canoe did you i did not see you there i know all who came in my canoe all who came in the bow and all in the stern if you were on board you must have been somewhere out of sight down iii the bilge i suppose bailing out the water rangiruatanuku was a chief of note and was no doubt very well informed in maori lore and if so his speech betrays the pride the maori of his time had in haavaikean descent which is suggestive of a superiority of the immigrant not only in his possession of seed and the art of cultivation but as having personal qualities such as tact and address skill at sea andaknowlede of war on shore as a a rule hawaikian blood has been more thought of and this has led many natives and many tribes unconsciously astray in figuring to themselves their ancient history a fact cannot be ignored for generations with impunity sooner or later it will become diminished in men minds or lost sight of altogether not that i have ever found a native ashamed of an aboriginal connection far from it but his other side seems always to be more present to him more engramed so to speak in his being and memory only once have i heard a maui maori speak in public with great and real pride of his unique and ancient descent that was when the chief of uepohatu or iwi pohatu a maui put the land of bis tribe at hikuranei mountain waiapu through the native land court of new zealand and obtained a legal title to it on that occasion the chief wi tahata said that he was descended from maui from whom he claimed he gave his genealogy 38 generations from maui he spoke of the hawaikians as having come to their island in canoes from across the sea in an age long after the time that they the maori nation had peopled it he showed the boundaries of the territory that belonged to his section of the maori nation before the hawakians came and the inroads that had since been made upon thorn and he asked me as tho judge of that court to accompany him to the top of the mountain there to view his his ancestors canoe in its rocky form a proceecfling however which to the court seemed unnecessary it was reserved for me to tell the jngaitai the name of the canoe they are connected with and i got my infoimation from firstclass tainui authority in the tainui country beyond taumata apanui at hawai lived the aboriginal tribe te manu koau who were conquered and scattered by te whanau apanui which is a tribe of mixed origin being partly of ngatiawa and partly pororangi blood ie of mataatua and takitunu but all of hawaikian extraction this tribe now lives on the land thus taken as for the remnant of te mann koau it fled through the mountains andcame to raukuinara mountain in hicks bay district here the refugees were discovered by the tribe of tuwhakairiora who killed and ate a number of them but when tv te rangiwhiu became aware of what was taking place he interposed and rescued them and made slaves of them setting them to work to catch the birds of that mountain tv te rangiwhiu was the chief of the tuwhakatnora tribe at that time now some three hundred years ago those slaves have been working there ever since i have eeen them myself and was much impressed with their timid deprecating cringing air and exceedingly rough exterior the man who placed them in bondage was a hawaikian and now i come to the iwi pohatu a maui or uepohatu as they now call themselves to whom i have just referred they live at tuparoa also they reside at the foot of hikurangi their antipodean ararat whose summit is shrouded in snow in winter and they have land at raukumara formerly their landed possessions were continuous between these points and their sea frontage extended from tuparoa to waiapu river this was a domain perhaps 40 miles long and 15 wide however ngatiporou who are hawaikiana of takituniuvone

as i being aboriginal and of maui desceiit adjoining uepohatu country to the west was a group of five aboriginal tribes their habitat extended from waiapu to potikirua near cape runaway these were the ngaoko at horoera hekawa and kawakawa the ruawaipu atpukeamaruand wharekahika hicks 5 bay and tlie three hapus of parariki viz parariki proper ngaituiti and ngaifcumoana the prefixes to the two latter names are probably of hawaikian origin these three hapus occupied the country between wharekahika and potikirua ngaituiti being at the wharekahika end of the district and ngaitumoana at the potikirua or western end rather more than four hundred years ago ngaoko for some reason attacked kuawaipu and destroyed them but a young chieftainesa named tamateaupoko escaped to whangaroa whereho marrieduekaihau of pororangi tribe a chief amongst the immigrants and a descendant of paikea the captain who brought takiturau from hawaiki to whangara near gisborne about six hundred years ago in due time three sous uetaha tamakoro and tahania the issue of this marriage grew up and determined to avenge the death of their grandfather and the pyerthrpwof his tribe they organised a strong force of the people of takitunu canoe thereafter known as ngaituere and set out by land along tbo coast at prengatoetoe the aetangahauiti endeavonred to stop their way but were defeated in pitch battle again at tawhiti te wahineiti attempted to bar their progress and were also defeated for the rest of their march they were unopposed until they encountered the offending ngaoko whom they vanquished in a series of engagements and seiges rather rather more than three hundred and fifty years ago ngaoko were scattered and killed their remnant reduced to captivity and their lands were appropriated by ngaituere who remained in undisputed possession until tuwhakairiora and his followers appeared upon the scene somo sixty years afterwards at this time therefore about 1530 ad the hawaikian people held the country from the mouth of the waiapii river to wharekahika and the aborigines continued to hold from the latter place to potikirua when tnwhakairiora who was a young chief descended from pororangi of hawaikian extraction appeared things became changed not only did he subjugate ngaituari who had attacked him wantonly but the three hapus of pajariki that had maintained their independence hitherto were disturbed by him parariki proper and ngaetumoana were driven from the holdings westward to whangaparaoa and the third ngaituiti from which he had married a wife kuataupare was reduced to a condition dependent upon himself of this extraordinary chief his origin and educa tion his mission his wars and conquests his revenge and of the tribe bearing his name that now occupies the country between te karituku and potikiruathat is to say from between waiapu and the east cape to between point lottin and cape runaway i niay speak more particularly later on in this narrative i have said that tuwhakairiora married ruataupare the manner in which he married this his first wife bespoke the dominant character of the man travelling alone he arrived for the first time on the shore of wharekahika bay and there he saw two young women in the water collecting shell fish their clothes were on the beach ha sat upon them after waiting long in the water for the stranger to continue his journey the women who were cold and ashamed came in from the sea and asked for their garments he gave them up and told the young women to take him to their parents kainga the worneu were ruataupare and auahi koata her sister on the way to the kainga ho told auahi that he intended to take ruatanpare to wife an event that speedily came to pass he was aware of the identity of the women when he eat on their clothes that marriage did not turn out well rnatupare considered herself ill used and loft her husband she went to her relatm3 at tokomaru she was half kahukuranui where she lived and died she conquered that district from the wahineiti the tribe living at tokomaru bears her name to this day we read in the journal of his voyage that it was here at tokomaru that cook first held friendly intercourse with the new zealanders the place was to say the least of an antochthonons atmosphere and we may not unreasonably assume it was here that that great navigator received an answer to a question that must have been uppermost in his mind when he was told that the name of the country he had come to was ehinomaul had he asked the same question at a purely immigrant settlement such as maketu mercury bay or the thames he would doubtless have been informed that that the name was aotearoalong white world and why simply because it was the name they had given to it when they arrived off the coast about 1290 a destimating a generation at 30 yearsand having sailed along the strange shore for hundreds of miles were impressed with its extent and its white appearance from the eastern precipices of the great barrier and mercury islands to the beaches and headlands of the bay of plenty and from to mahia to past the east cape all the coast line was more or less white in colour as the eastern summer sun shone upon it the few dark rocks only brought the white into relief and increased the impression t and they were partially hidden too by the foliage of the pohutukawa tree that was not to knov the white man axe for several hundred years to come thus history in her unceasing round repeated her recnr rent m-ays and the ancient britain of thu south becameanother albion to another band of strangers who came to occupy her soil the whatumamoa were another tribe of aboriginal maoris they lived at hawke bay near napier one of their principal pas was te heipipi near petane and they had a pa near taradale and other pas this tribe was attacked by a section of the descendants of the immierrantsbytakitumu canoe who came under teraia from nukutanrua they fought against te heipipi pa but were unable to take it on account as they believed of the antochthon god of the pa being superior to their own god therefore they made peace with te heipipi but they took some other whatumamoa pas and eventually the residue of the aborigines became absorbed in the takitrnnu people now known as ngatikahungungn a tribe of aborigines called te tauira lived at wairoa hawke bay who were numerous and had many pas their principal pa was at rakautihia they were attacked by a section of the takituinn1 people who having got into trouble at home had migrated from turanga to waihan on the hngaroa this party was led by rakaipaka and hincmanuhiri they lived awhile at waihau and there under some provocation made war on te tauira and to prevent quarrels after conquest they apportioned the lands of to tauira aniongst themselves before the war commenced the war resulted in the complete conquest and expatriation of the tanira tribe whose refugees fled to hawke bay and wnirarapaj where some hapus of their tribe lived the only person paved by rakaipaka was a woman named hinekura he saved her because he had had an intrigue with her before the trouble beaftv in this war it wasat the baivtlo or tanpara 1 that the tauifa tribe was crushed lastly a large tribe of maui maoris named to marancaranga inhabited to whaiti country they were destroyed by the descendants of the immigrants of mataatua canoe i have now covered the ground from the upper thames to hawke bay inclusive by the east coafc and far back into the interior to the middle of the island nearly excepting two paps on the coast namely from north of te mania tfb south of tuparoa te tauira occupied te mahia and from potikirua near cape runaway to maraenui i have not the information in respect to the ancient inhabitants of these two areas necessary to enable me to state with precision who they were and what became of them we all know however that excepting lands alienated to europeans the former is held entirely by the descendants of hawaikiana that is of tho men who landed at whangara from takitumn with paikea their captain who very likely fixed on that locality because he saw no aborigines there into the lattifer as we have seen ngaetumoana and parariki proper were driven by tuwhavairiora we also know that ngatiawa are living in that district nnw under the names of neae tawarere and whanan thutu there is therefore perhaps to romp extent an admixture of the aboriginal element if two tribes i am not however able to affirm anything having never travelled in their country nor had opportunitysto inquire and in covering theground named i have covered the whole of three spheres of influenc namely of the three canoes takitumn mataatua and tainui in so far w the relations of the immigrants with the aborigines are concerned this qualification is necessary because i am not now treating of wars that took place in remote parts of the island between the outpost colonies of the various canoes such as the war between tainui and arawa people at taupo four hundred years ago when the latter ousted the former from the south and east sides of the lake or the wars between the people of takitumu and tainui after that at moawhango and the upper rangitikei rivers when the latter were again expelled these wars amongst the descendants of the immigrants in remote parts were bitter struggles for territory not mere tribal strife with an utu account and they usually ended in one side being crushed and driven off the same thing took place between ngatiawa of-mataatua and ngatiporou of takitnmu their theatre of war was about te kaha where there were many campaigns te kaha pa obtained its name from the number of seiges it withstood in that war in determining dates i have estimated a generation at 30 years duration which period all circumstances considered seems pretty reasonable as a chronological standard of course any estimate of this sort is necessarily arbitary the reader however can reduce it if he thinks the unit too large at the same time it is well to remember that many maori chiefs had many succeeding wives and the geanologies preserved embrace not infrequently the youngest born of the youngest as well as the first born of the first wife nor had the latter a monopoly of distinction twhakairiora tuhourangi tutanekai hine moa and others were all youngest or nearly youngest children yet each is a prominent figure in maori tradition in concluding this sketch in the history of the antochthons of new zealand let me say that all the facts set forth have been imparted to me by the maoris themselves excepting as already stated such things as i learned from my father in the forties he prosecuted his inquiries in the thirties and forties and was one of the very few in those early times who took an interest in the history laws and customs of the maoris before his death he wrote to me from england urging me to publish my information on these subjects my next chapter will be upon the voyage of the hawaikians from their own country to new zealand to be continued", "flood at hawke bay loss of life and property napier april 19 never within the history of

napier boats take wrong course and go via papakura frou odb special ekpoetbe by tblkghaph fapndon this day clive is in a terrible state people in town who have not seen it cannot realise the amount of devastation that has been wrought by the present heavy rain which culminated last night in a terrible flood last evening at about eight oclock it was noticed by one or two residents that the tuki tuki river which is about a mile and a-half away from the township had commenced to overflow the water was just coming over the bank but of course nothing whatever was thought of it mr glazebrook butcher was one of the first to notice that it was overflowing and expected an ordinary fresh but nothing more it was thought that if it was mthing more serious the muddy creek close by would be capable of carrying the superfluous water away down to the mouth ofthe ngaruroro nver where it would discharge it however clive went to bed at the usual hour and slept in fancied security at twelve oclock there was not a single drop of water about the township but half an hour later there was a terrific roar a bang and a crash clive was flooded the tuxi tuki had broken out near the bridge had rushed through the maori ploughed paddock and came over at n groat rate to clive the exact location of the outbreak was between tuki tuki bridge the maori pah and matahiwi tho residents of east and west olive at first did not recognise their danger or the great calamity that had fallen on them gradually it began to rise the people hastily dressed but before they had done so the water was up to their beds as it contibued to rise rapidly it was apparent to all that an effort must be made to save the people live 3 then there was a terrible scene of excitement a scene which beggars description men yelhd bawled and cooeed for assistance women screamed in their fright and terrified children cried in mortal agony hundreds of cows swam about the township bellowing furiously horses neighed pigs screamed cackled and the noise mado resemoiu appeals to be sayd like those from dying men or bea6ts then there was the howling wind and fearful din made by the rushing waters which now held posses bion of the township and rushed pellmell taking everything with them into the wgaiuroro river which is crossed by the bridge whioh approaches clive the people absolutely went frantio could nothing be done to save them i where were tho boats they yelled knowing all the time that there were no boats in the locality the men absolutely took their guns and sent chargtß of bullets powder and shot through the ceilings of their houses in order hat they could cry for help through stand by and look at all the stock about th country aud everything portable in thf village float by at a terrible pace constable kennedy happens to live just across th bridge on the highest seotion in the townt ship and he got mr hislop station-mastei at farndon to telegraph into kergeanl cullen at napir for assistance in the way of sending out boats eto he also got mr james oconnell to ride into napier at half pst two oclock on a similar errand some houses were on higher ground than 1 others but agonised parents had to stand by all night and watch their goods floating about their houses in dire confusion and to raise their ohildren on to a higher elevation as the water rose it was a terrible night aid will never be forgotten as long as those who live at olive remain in existence one man had to get out at the gable end of his houso and numerous other instacces could be recorded that occurred during the night when daylight made its appearance of course people know what they wero doing and things were not si bad people were all night endeavoring to get their stock on to dry land there was a considerable amount of difficulty about this a3 the cattle were frantic and did not know what they were doing ihere was a terrible lot of water on tho low lying land and a great many cows and sheep were drowned there was a great wash away at this place and there was a rumor not only in napier but at farndon that the waitangi road bridge had been carried away this was not the case however as i crossed it safely early this morning and although there was a great rush of wattr underneath it it appeared quite safe for any kind of traffic the railway bridge opposite is all right too although there are no trains running but a culvert is washed away right from the yhamrock hotel at awatoto the road is under water almost to farndon and it is not pleaant riding especially for a long stretch at waitangi where one has to traverse a suspicious looking invisible road cows and horses are to be seen on the high road and in the paddocks perched or huddled together on the diyest spots obtainable twelve head of cattle in their franctic state swam into the yard of one house this morning over the fence swam back again and then over again not knowing where they were going to until they were all drowned now as to the assistance rendered from napier pilot kraef t came out in a special train with his staff and life-boat accompanied by superintendent lucas of the spit fire brigade and one or two other firemen they were dropped down at waitangi as the train could go no further and had to rome on to clive the best way they could four other big boats also came out from napier but instead of taking the inside route they went round papakura way somewhere and at the time of writing they had not arrived at the ecene of devastation they having taken the wrong route will no doubt prove useful in another direction there was a rumor in napier that people were drjwned but that cannot possibly be ascertained there is only the lifeboat and another boat here at present going out to the different bouses rescuing men women and children in a perilous position a dozen or fifteen boats are wanted for work at the time of wiring they had not gone round to waipiriki which is a mile or two away that is the place whore people are likely to have lost their lives as it is near the tuki tuki riveralongside in fact and consequently the water would be much higher and they would receive the first great shock of the loosened river the boa are pulled about with great difficulty owine to the swiftness of the tide one got stove againt a fence there is from five to eight feet of water about tho place but at the flour mill ther is from nine to ten feet horsemen oan of course only venture fifty yards from the bridgo ihere is great danger in going any further the people in the hotel over the bridge are imprisoned upstairs all tbose rescued in the boat are taken to mr smith hotel at farndon where they are being fed and given old clothes blankets eto the house is nearly full of humanity and wet clothes there was no meat in the place and two young men rode over against the tide to nelson butcher thop and after great difficulty managed to obtain some mutton for the hotel which was hanging up in the chop for hungry people to eat when one comes to contemplato what this visitation means to tbe people in a small way of business in clive it is a sorrowful thing asked this morning what was the amount of damage done approximately by the flood so far one old resident said in a most pathetic voice every man in clive has lost everything and hasnt got clothes to wear except the wot ones he has on everything has been swept away except the houses and for ought i know at present lor there is no means of ascertainingthere may be loss of life mr robinson of pakowhii who bad his sheep on low land lost a few thousand of them but mr thompson got his up ou to dry land yesterday and they are saved although in aud about the farndon hotel is just about dry bo to speak anyone could swim about the football ground in famdon park men women and children are standing by the bridge anxiously waiting the retura of the boats with the people who were in danger constable kennedy house has ab jut tho least water in but at the back of it the tide is rushing into the river this flood completely eclipses in every shape and form the flood which swept olive eleven years ago last juue so old identities say the

to report generally on the subject of the customs establishment at the chatham islands also to furnish statistical information respecting the trade population and resources of those islands in submitting to you my report for the information of the honorable the commissioner of customs i shall endeavor to notice each of the subjects to which my attention has been directed in the order in which they stand in the paragraph quoted above respecting the trade of the chatham islands i have to submit the following information which i gathered from various sources and believe to bo correct from the year 1841 to about 1851 four to six whaling ships generally visited the islands every year for supplies during the succeeding years 1855 to 1857 when potatoes were in such demand for the australian market their visits became less frequent and for the last three years 183 d 1859 and 1800 they have principally touched at pitt island and procured supplies from the two europeans messrs hunt and llofgnault resident there in 1880 the natives who up to that time had always resided on the main island found that vessels from australia ceased v to arrive for their potatoes and that the whaling ships visited the neighboring island only so a number of them went across and established themselves there also so as to be ablctoobtaina share of the trade during that year i understand nine whaling ships called there but as many of them i am told purchased the supplies they required for cash few dutiable articles were landed from them however this may be certain it is that on the main island 1 found with the exception of the tobacco as i said before nu evidence of any quantity of dutiable goods having been landed there for some time the european residents had long been without tea sugar and such like articles and the natives i observed were becoming so badly off for clothing that the women were beginning to make mats again an occupation that they had previously abandoned for years potatoes are at present almost the only things grown large crops of which are raised year after year from the same ground with very little labor it has been almost exclusively for these that the trade to the inlands has hitherto been carried on very little wheat or grain of any kind has been raised since the potatoes firdt began to realize such high prices one year the jvlaories were paid as much as six pounds ts a ton for them by the traders from australia in 1851 about 2000 tons were shipped for sydney and melbourne in the purchase of which it is estimated that the traders spent about five thousand pounds 5000 in cash and as much more in goods altogether from 1854 to 1856 inclusive about seven thousand 030 tons were exported anil it was during that time that so many vessels visited the islands and that a considerable trade was carried on at present there is scarcely any sign among the natives of the prosperity they attained to in those years beyond the number of horses which they possess as most of the money they received for their produce was soon most foolishly dissipated in 1859 tiie whole potato crop about two thousand 2000 tons rotted in the ground for want of purchasers in isoo five vessels arrived from australia and took away aboutfourhundredand fifty 450 tons and three vessels from new zealand shipped about one hundred and fifty tons 150 more these all cost on an average three pounds 4 a ton so that last year about eighteen hundred pounds 1800 most part in trade was laid out ou the islands the goods taken from new zealand were no doubt all duty paid at the ports at which they were shipped in consequence of these few vessels calling last year the natives again made large plantations both maories and europeans assured lao that the crop for the present season would yield at least two thousand 2000 tons and from what i saw myself i believe this to be a low estimate at waitarigi alone there were at least two hundred 200 tons of the finest potatoes i ever saw brought into the pah to be ready for shipment with the exception of one hundred and sixty 150 tons shipped for wellington all this large crop like that of js5 must rot on the ground the esther has been the only vessel that has called to load this year in the three trips she has made there have baen whipped seven hundred and thirty-two 702 bushels of wheat one hundred and sixty-two 162 tons of potatoes and about twelve hundred 1200 pounds of wool tiie cost of this would bj about three hundred and fifty piunds 350 and more than two-thirds of this was paid for in goods duty paid in new zealand the natives this year have been glad to take one pound l a ton for their potatoes delivered on boardthe vessel the price of wheat has bjen four shillings 45 a bushel in former years there were several whaling stations on the main island and last yeiir the muories had some boat out and obtained a few tuns of oil but this enterprise has now altogether ceased the european population of the chatham islands is now very small heyond the three german settlers and their families ami mr shanrl and family on the main island and the families of messrs hunt and ryignaulr on

number to be forty-six only viz thirty-three adults and thirteen children i found great difficulty at first in iiiy endeavours to ascertain the present number of maories and aborigines all the estimates both y natives and europeans differed very widely shortly after my arrival however a large mrnbsr of natives assembled at kaingaroa to see me and i took some pains to induce them to mike a complete list of ths name of all the native inhabitants of tha dinveut settlements round tiie island in this i succeeded and believe the list i procured of which i beg to enclose a copy to be perfectly correct as i had several opportunities of testiuar its accuracyj i enclose also an abstract of this nominal liet which shows the native population to l3 as follows aboriginal or morioris 100 mnorifis 413 half castes by european fathers 17 total o0 five hundred and ninety s nils from this return it will be seen that the natives mist be vapidly on the decline as there are only sixty-fo ir children ti five hundred and nine adults at kaingaroa and the a ijacent kaingas which comprises about half of the population thirty-four nearly all adults have die i since 1850 aid seventeen only have bsen bora ia the sime period several years ago the lord bishop of is tev zealand took alist similar to the one i obtained and then the natives i was told numbered over a thousand it would be interesting now to compare the two lists so as to ascertain the exact rate of decrease it should bs noted that in additisn t those who have died about thirty left for taranaki by the ksther in 1556 kvcrywhere that i met tlie poor morions i found them delighted to see me but the maories appeared to exercise a most suspicious vigilance over their actions and rarely left them a moment alone to talk to me the miserable remnant of this ill-used people i believe cling most tenaciously to the belief that his excellency government will ere long restore them to freedom and to the possession of some portion of the land which was so cruelly wrested from them by their maori conqueror it is estimated thatthere mnsthave been three thousand aborigine on the islani whsn the maories first reached there twenty-five years ago the greater part of these were slaughtered at once and the remainder subjected to a state of the most oppressive slavery of late years however their condition has much improved i believe they are not now bsaten or ill-used aud they are allowed to cultivate the ground for their own benefit in common with the maories the men are also now allowed to take wives which they were not formerly permitted to do bit are still prohibited from marrying maori women only two instances have occurred of mtriori men having taken maori wives and in-one of these the woman was formerly a slave in new zealand the maories have a large number of horses there must bs nearly five hundred now on the island as upwards of n hundred principally breeding mares were brought down by the traders from sydney in the years 1353-51 anl 55 there must ba also about a thousand head of cattle but most of these are running wild in the bush i observed everywhere fine much cows and working bullocks in excellent condition about the pahs at tupuange the maaries have from eighty to a hundred shoep but of these they take so little cave that the dogs destroy them faster than they can increase the europeans have about thirteen hundred sheep which thrive pretty well half of these are are on pitt island and belong to mr hunt i regret very much that i am not able to offer any correct estimate of the size of tiie islands or of the quantity of available land as i have never seen a chart oi them and the short time i was there i had little opportunity of gathering reliable information on these points j nor had i an opportunity of visiting pitt island but persons who had been there describad it to be of small extent covered with bush throughout almost entirely steep hilly land withno good harbor and only two places where a landing can be effected with any safety as to the resources of the islands the best information i can supply i think will be a shert description of the nature and quality of the so 1 and it 3 productions in the centre of the main island which is nearly all low and undulating there is a large salt w ter or brftjkisb lake occupying fully one third of its area this lake has a hard sandy bottom and is easily fordablo over abrit half of its extent where the mouth is open at the point where its waters flow into the sea at times however after heavy gales of wind i believe this is closed up and then it is too deep to b3 crossed except in boats a large portion of it is always very deep nearly all round the sea coast thers is a belt of bunh varying in width from a mile or more down to one or two ltumlrc-t yards this portion comprise the best land between it and tvj lake the ground is open and is covered either with flax or with rushes low fern and a kind of heather the flax land is generally good the other is mostly very wet au4 owampy even on the highest parts but it could all be easilr drained as it appears to be everywhere considerably abjve tlis level of the lake the soil throughout is light and rich and is composed principally of peat mixed with fine quartz sand varying in their proportions in different places in somo parts near the sea coast the quartz sand entirely prevails forming long lines of sand-hills in others the ground is composed exclusively of peat in many places in the open ground this fine white quartz is 80 thickly strewn over the surface as to present the appearance of a recent fall of snow the bush land which is the only part that has yet been cultivated is the richest tint 1 have ever seen it sustains a dense growth of vegetation and when cleared yields abundant crop of the same kind for many years in succession wheat oats and barley have been cultivated witli great success all the english fruit trees such as the apple pear peach plum and cherry c grow most luxuriantly and bear well anything that is cultivated iv the middle island of new zealand would do well i have no doubt at the chatham islands as the climate and temperature must be much alike the crops never suffer from drought and no blight of any kind has yet made its appear a change of seed wheat is much required as the sort the mnories now have from want of proper care ami attention lias much deteriorated if a few bushels of really good seed wheat and barley could be sent down for distribution among the natives it would have a-most beneficial effect and would perhaps be the means of inducing them to cultivate more grain for which there would always be a steady demand at remunerative prices and they would then not have the mortification of seeing their whole year labour thrown away as is now the case in consequence of potatoes being the only crop cultivated for which as i have before pointed out there is no purchaser at all great benefit would also result from sending at the same time some white clover seed which if only scattered over the abandoned maori cultivations would soon rapidly spread over the island besides converting these waste places into excellent pasturage at almost all the pahs there are small patches of english grass which look rich and luxuriant butj did not see any clover the principal woods are the karakn ake ake matepo hoo and karemu i enclose a list of all the trees that are found on the island with a brief description showing the size they grow to and the various uses for which they are

harbour it is commodious it is quite landlocked and has deep water close to the beach this i wa told by the master of a vessel who had been there for i had not time to visit it myself unfortunately i understand the land in its vicinity is swampy and there is no timber near from the abundance of quartz and other indications similar to what i have observed at otago i have little doubt that gold will bi found at the chatham islands and i am confirmed in this impression by the opinion of a gentleman in wellington of acknowledged authority in such matters to whom i showed specimens of the rocks that i brought back with me altogether it must appear from what i have stated above respecting the soil climate and productions of the chatham islands that thay are admirably suited for settlement and occupation by europeans yet it is doubtful i think whether settlers without some special advantages being granted to them could ba induced to go there while so much land yet remains open for selection

of bsing locatel at ro great distance from large and thriving towns the centres of commerce and civilization under all circumstances 1 cannot help remarking that these islands impressed me as bains

DAMAGE IN WELLINGTON AND ELSEWHERE. About 10.22 a.m. yesterduy a proloused shock of earthquake wos felt in Now Plymouth, the direction being from east to west. There was a lengthy tremor before aud after the ( more severe shake, which caused mild consternation umongst occupants ol buildings in town. The tall smoke stack at the Egmont mills swayed considerably. No damage is report- i ed, Telograms show the shock trav- > ersed the whole of the island, and as far south as Christchurch, doing considerable damage to brick chimneys, and in some cases to brick buildings. A Press Association message from Wellington states that the earthquake yesterday morning was considered the most alarming since the great shock of 1855, The two buildings which Buffered most were the Government Insurance olllce and Public Lilmary. Both have shown weakness in former quakes, and from both masses of cornice and pedimont fell yesterday. The main tower of the former is considered unsafe, and the plaster of the interior suffered considerably. The library is closed, and this stake will probably expedite the rebuilding, which has all along seemed likely to be forced on the council. One wall is now fcut of plumb, and the inside littered with debris fallen from the fcool and walls. The Town Hall and other edifices in course of erection stood the ordeal well. Many chimneys were upset, and plaster suffered largely in various cases, but no structural damage soemf to have occurred. The destruction of private property in dwellinghouses, taken together, is- considerable, as numbers oV them have to report losses of breakable articles, and in shops and hotels much damage was done in this way. Messrs Smith and Smith had £BOO worth of plate glass smashed in their warehouse. E. W. Mills and Co., ironmongers, had a nurabor of ranges tin-own down and broken.

The water in the harbour was not affected, but vessels quivered a good deal. There were a good many inquiries during the day as to what might havo happened in the Lake country, especially at Wainiong-u, and some relief nnd astonishment were expressed when it was found the shock had scarcely been felt there.

Allen was present during the afternoon. \"Fifty-one,\" in the Haweva Star, recalls that in tho 'sixties the Waiwakaiho bridge (entirely a wooden structure) was carried away and' landed some distance down stream, near the old ford. The bridge was re-built again in wood, but with stone piers, this structure being replaced in 1907. The rainfall for Tuesday and Wednesday in Eltham is the heaviest recorded. For the 24 hours ending at 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning the record was 1.00 inches, 'and from ft o'clock on Wednesday till !) o'clock next morning it was 2.80 inches, or a total for the 48 hours of 3.80 inches. A meeting of the council of the New Plymouth Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday afternoon, when the. remit'! to the conference of Chambers of Commerce, which is to be held in Wellington on November 22 and 23, were discussed. The meeting was in favor of sending a delegate to the conference, but as no one present signified his willingness to represent the Chamber, the ■question of electing a delegate was left in abeyance in the meantime. The meeting arranged details in connection with the deputation to wait on the Hon. J)r. R. MeNab, Acting-Postmaster-Genera!, this evening relative to the Tahora-Tatu telephone. In replying to a vote of llianka accorded to him at yesterday's meeting of tho Comforts Week Committee, Mr. V. W. G. McLeod, the lion, secretary, said he was glad to have been of service. As bandmaster he was prepared to do his very best for the welfare of the people of New Plymouth, and he was assured his efforts would receive active support. He paid a tribute to the good work done by the members of the band during the Comforts Week campaign, and stated he had a scheme in view which would take the form of an entertainment whereby Christmas presents for the members would be provided. He looked for, and felt sure he would get, the support of the public for any entertainment he might arrange in the future. The band had made excellent progress musically, and he had every confidence that a high standard of work would be attained. There is, says the Hon. W. Carneross. an intense desire on the part of many British politician's to so amend the Constitution as to permit of overseas representation at Westminster. The idea is shared by politicians cf varying political creeds. The popular feeling is that the British dominions have done such magnificent work in connection with- the war that they now have an undeniable claim for direct representation, and a voice to be heard on all future occasions when Britain contemplates engaging in war. But although there is a widespread and earnest desire to afford this representation when the question is closely approached, and an attempt made to deal with it in a- practical manner, the obstacles to a practical solution loom up tremendously. An address on the subject was delivered to the delegates by a very prominent person, and in the debate which followed the delegates handled the matter very freely, and pointed out many of, the great difficulties that stood in the way. —Eltham Argus. Treatment accorded returned soldiers came in for some severe strictures from one of the members of tlie Parihaka Road Board on Thursday. Sir. O'Brien asked whether the Board had given any donation to the Wounded Soldiers' or Red Cross, funds. Mr. Harvey pointed out that they were not dealing with their own money, but with that of the ratepaers, and that the Kgmont County Council, representing the same ratepayers, had already donated ;C 100. Mr. W. B. Smith asked what was the use of giving money when returned men had to sign i.o.n.'s for any money that was loaned to them? People, he said, gave freely, but the men did not get the money. Mr. Harvey did not think tin's was so. The men could get assistance if they went about the matter in the proper way. Mr, Willoughby considered that the state of the roads did not warrant the Board giving away ratepayers' money. We 'always gave freely to patriotic subscriptions, and though the better plan would be for members of the Board to make a donation personally. Mr. O'Brien considered that the men at the front had done a lot, and the ratepayers would not feel the donation. Personally, if any returned soldier came along, he would give him half his dinner. Weather permitting, the annual athletic sports in connection with the Boys' High School will be held next Thursday on the school grounds. The entries this year show an increase of 250.0ver those of last year, there being in one race alone over 130 competitors. Tn all. over 200 boys will take part, and if the weather is favorable a most enjoyable meeting should be held. Afternoon tea will be procurable on the grounds for the small charge of (id, the proceeds being devoted to the Soldiers' Comforts Fund. A cordial invitation is extended to all friends of the school.

Mr. C. A. Wilkinson, M.P., has received a reply to his letter to the Land Purchase Board concerning the purchase' of Messrs. Bayley's and Perry's properties at Tututawa. The reply states that the Board cannot recommend the purchase of Mr, Bayley's property, but recommends the purchase of Mr. Perry's, which comprises about 700 acres. The To-kaora correspondent of the flau'era Star, who visited the mouth of the Waingongoro yesterday, reports that, as a sequel to the flood, the eastern end of the swing bridge has been washed away, though it is still attached at the westdrn side, while the boatsheds have been undermined, and the boats are standing in the water. The bank of boulders and gravel in front of Mr. Henry Tc Kiri's place has been washed away, leaving a drop of seven or eight feet. Two metal drays are standing in the middle of the river, forming a little island, and the sea beach is very rough with boulders. A sad burning fatality occurred at Waverley early on Thursday morning, when a little boy named Roscue received injuries that resulted in his death. The little fellow was left in bed asleep whilst the others were out milking, and it is supposed he got some matches and set himself on lire. His screams brought his parents, who found the clothes almost hurnt off him. The doctor was called, and the little sufferer removed to the iPatca Hospital, but the injuries were so severe that the little fellow succumbed almost immediately after admission,—Press.

moriori men having taken maori wives and in one of those the woman was formerly a slave in new zealand ihe maorios have a large number of horses there must be nearly five bundled now on the island as upwards of a hundred principally breeding mares weie brought down by the traders from sydney in the years 1851-51 and 55 there must be also about a thousand head of cattle but most of these are running wild in tlie bush i observed everywhere fine milch cows and working bullocks in excellent condition about the pahs at tupuange the maories have from eighty to a hundied sheep but of these they

remunerative prices and they wouh then not have the mortification of seeing their whole year labour thrown away as is now the case in conequence of potatoes being tho only crop cultivated for which as

remembered in greymouth as the most serious calamity from which the i community suffered during the first seven years of the settlement of the west coast fortunately the most valuable house property in the town is placed in the safest situation and the business centre has escaped from anything more serious than temporary inconvenience or partial loss but the change for the worse in the general appearance of the town is very considerable of the government township the greater part has gone to sea or has floated up the lagoon in an indescribable state of wreck from johnston street seaward the entire line of buildings fronting the river has disappeared and the buildings immediately beyond the front row including strike and blackmore brewery are left in a situation of considerable danger on the occasion of any future floods with the buildings went the protective works and the lower part of the town presents altogether a sorry spectacle as if the flood were not a sufficiently serious disaster of itself a fire broke out in the same block and although it fortunately did not spread there was seen the rare sight of burning buildings tumbling into the turbid waters and floating out to sea and fire was not the only companion of the flood fears are entertained that it was accompanied by loss of life but there is no v definite knowledge of more than one fatal accident from a house which floated away containing an entire family one young person a son of mr william dale was washed away by the flood and drowned the other members of the family narrowly escaping a similar fate at the upper end of the town the protection works and wharf have been sadly shaken a considerable incision having been made in the stone and timber embankment contiguous to the gorge and thie custom house wharf which was of strong but ancient material having subsided into the river for nearly half its length the most noticeableand prominent feature of the effects of the flood however is the disappearance of the river frontage of the lower township greymouth no longer presents to the visitor that imposing appearance upon which its inhabitants have often been complimented the long line of buildings which fronted the river and which so impressed the stranger has been vastly reduced in dimensions and though the property which has been destroyed was by no means the most valuable or the most imposing it is not alone in appearance that the loss will be felt many other parts of the town have been suddenly and strangely metamorphosed but municipal and personal outlay will soon restore to order and seemliness what is now so disordered and unseemly the rain which resulted in this heavy flood began to fall on wednesday and duruag all that jjight it fell so constantly that daany feared ithe occurrence of an unusual fresh but nothing more expectation was excited as the rain continued throughout thursday but thefeuddenness and extent of the flood exceeded all expectations towards afternoon the waters rose rapidly and some time before dusk they had overflown the protection works and were streaming into the back parts of the town by all the cross streets before this time precautions had been taken by the mayor and others to warn the inhabitants of all theibwlying parts and to remove all families who desired to be removed towards dusk the number of emigrants from these parts increased and all the principal hotels became crowded with family groups and their household gods as the river reached the level of the protection works and streamed along the streets storekeepers busied themselves in erecting ingeniously contrived barricades at their front doors and these were for a time serviceable in preventing the influx of the muddy water until goods were raised from the floors but subsequently all buildings were more or less flooded and householders and storekeepers patiently waited knee-deep in water for the subsidence of the flood this did not come until midday on friday and the incidents which occurred in the interval incidents alarming and amusing would require a record columns long the front street if street it might be called was crowded by pedestrians of whose pedal extremities little was seen drays were busily employed in removing goods from low-lying stores and boats plied from place to place removing beleaguered families or bold individuals who held to their houses long after they were safely tenable it seems to be a feature of these occasions that ladies take to lying in just on the eve of a flood and more than one who had become a mother just a few hours previously had to be removed by a boat or in the arms of friends from the quiet of the sick chamber to the noisy hotel in these instances it was well that the precaution of removal was early taken for nearly all the houses on the flat on which the principal part of the town stands were soon surrounded and filled to the depth of several feet the first buildings to float away were four or five small cottages in critical positions on the bank of the tidal creek which intersects the town some of these canted collapsed and sailed away with the stream with all their contents and became completely wrecked as they collided with the tramway bridge they thus became a contributory cause of the carrying away of the bridge itself which now lies with the tramway rails and a mass of dibris as an enormous barricade to the traffic of hospital street other and smaller bridges gave way and all communication with the terraces was interrupted except by boats v in two instances the little houses which were swept away floated from their slight foundations with such short notice that their contents went with them and the samaritan spirit which became so generally prevalent for the next twelve hours was first exercised in saving the few articles of furniture or ornament which were found floating about as the evening advanced every street in the town was under water and the current at corners and along the streets at right angles to the stream was so swift that walking was dangerous work and swimming was often the involuntary resort this circumstance and the existence of numerous man traps seemed however rather to be relished by pedestrians than otherwise and the ambition appeared to be to get as thoroughly wet as possible and to meet with some moving accident or hair-breadth scape before going to bed when this ambition was accompanied by whisky it was rather indiscreetly exercised and it is due more to good luck than superior navigation that we have not the melancholy duty of recording the fact of some young spirits losing the number of their mess in other instances there was some real risk run by perfectly sober people some falling into cellars and others being carried off their feet in dangerous proximity to deep water but fortunately there was no fatal accident so far as we have heard the risk to property was first most imminent at ten oclock on thursday night and the locality where the danger was concentrated was between boundary street and the european hotel nor only were the protection works at this point most insecure but an immense gathering of snags and of timber intended for the repair of the works accumulated in front of the houses and began to act as battering rams against the flimsy fronts even at that hour the appearances here were really alarming the creakings of the houses and the collapse of verandahs indicating the immense pressure before which the buildings ultimately suc cumbed indicative of danger as the appearances were most people continued to occupy their houses though warning had been given and boats engaged for their removal and the wonder is tfkat when the crash came several lives were nt lost as it was there were some narrow escapes and a few persons were in very critical positions before they were saved by boats there is a story of one man having been een on the roof of a house as it was washed out to sea but there is no certainty that euch was the case it is true that mr george sadler of the reefton express floated down the stream for some distance on one f the buildings but at some risk he reached 4he shore fortunately the floating away of the houses did not occur till j daylight otherwise the loss of property oould scarcely have failed to have been aciocwnpanied by considerable loss of life tsxe serious results of this sudden overflow of water throughout the town only bacasm fully apparent by noon on friday amd tshejr were so generally diffused that it is impossible except by occupying a great deal of space to describe them in detail it is indeed difficult to say where the description should begin and where it should end the destruction of the block to the seaward of johnston street is of course the great feature of the effects of the flood but in every corner of the town there has been some destruction of property which at another time would be prominently recorded by the paragraphist let the reader of this report who may be acquainted with greymouth imagine himself starting on his survey of the town from the grey side of the gorge and pursuing his journey down the streets until he reaches the site of the powder magazine that was but no longer is except as a wreck upon some point of the northern beach at the foot of the cliffs which form the south side of the gorge are situated a number of boatmen huts the water was all round these shifting some and laying level others but not altogether demolishing a group of structures which certainly might well be spared for all they contribute either to the borough rates or the picturesque they adjoin a maori reserve upon which is posted the warning anyone breaking down the fence or trespassing on this reserve will be prosecuted a warning which had less to do with the saving of the aforesaid fence than its elevated situation for at the other end of the town the flood paid little attention to the announcement no admittance which messrs strike and blackmore have prominently painted on their premises immediately below the boatmen huts begin the protective works and here begins also the work of destruction the stonework still stands thoroughly well washed but the wooden piles protrude themselves like the quills of the fretful porcupine and they serve as a sort of preliminary introduction to greater damage further down this damage has been done to the customhouse wharf an ancient and honest structure which has been shorn of its fair proportions as far down as the transit shed it has gone bodily into the river bearing down with it two coal barges one belonging to messrs m lean and co and the other to mr george martin and in the latter there were eighteen tons of coal an item only of mr martin losses for at the other end of the town his coal wharf and hotel the cove of cork were both included in the general disappearance of property below the transit shed the same wharf is wonderfully and fearfully contorted and as a whole its days may be said to be done its destruction is a serious feature of the damage effected by the flood as it weakens the protective works at the very point at which the risk of river encroachment is greatest it was a gauge of the last greatest flood four years ago that there were two inches of water in the shed built upon this wharf but on this occasion there were two feet of water or even more on the other side of the street in this vicinity stands glenn bros bond except its galvanised iron fence it escaped damage ehodes ferry hotel and rudd store which are contiguous were less fortunate they shared in the general flooding and the fronts of the houses are considerably damaged between these and the hut which is dignified with the designation of harbour office an enormous body of water found its way into the old tributary of the river the tidal creek and the wonder is that the harbour-master domicile did not share the fate of his cabbages fowls and flowers all fencing here disappeared and what was once a flowerbed is now a shingle-bed as are also the beautiful flower-plots and the gardens of mr mbeth postmaster mr revell rm and mr andrews collector of customs in all the buildings here including the post office and telegraph office the water stood from three to five feet according to their elevation and in the two offices there was much spoiling of papers as there was of furniture in the houses from captain ahardyce house mrs allardyce at the time in a most delicate condition had to be removed in a boat to johnston hotel where many others found shelter in front of the telegraph office a gigantic snag deposited itself after knocking down a telegraph post and temporarily suspending the communication moored at the lower end of the custom house wharf was the steamer dispatch with steam up and anchor out and there she remained in safety but in her vicinity a humble structure occupied as the wharfinger office came to grief subsiding into a hole and departing muchly from the perpendicular from this point down mawbera quay presents the appearance of a well-washed shingle bed but is perfectly safe for traffic the footpath is different great gaps have been made in its surface alongside many of the buildings and it was one of the flood freaks to make these gaps usually in the front of the banks hotels or leading stores they were dangerous traps while the water was flowing and will require some amount of filling up before the pavement is restored to its pristine state of roughness for thin-soled pedestrians but the most extraordinary excavation of this description was achieved by the flood in tainui street where tons upon tons of soil were removed so in boundary street was a great transformation scene effected to the detriment of a wonderful design in drains by the town surveyor but to record all the superficial changes in the streets would require a special work on greymouth topography alongside mawhera quay the charles edward waipara and garibaldi were stoutly moored and no accident happened to these sea going craft but that prominent item of the marine architecture pi the port the doctor yacht met with ah accident though it was not a source of total loss for wickes timber wharf and its load of timber considerable fears were entertained but there was not much of the timber floated away and some of what was floated served as a useful purpose with other material in stopping the stream from impinging too smartly on ashton and other contiguous hotels it was immediately be yond this point that the serious damage was lone the protective works were snapped suddenly off at this point and as the river ran furiously past it rapidly excavated the brushwood and shingle of which thebank was formed and made a straight course seaward the result was the reduction of the roadway to a mere narrow strip until at skoglund and purcellscorner it disappeared altogether their store stands on the brink of a steep bank alongside of which the river flows as deeply as at any part of its course and their buildings and others adjacent are in imminent danger on the first occasion of a flood of following all the lower part of the town which has already gone their premises form the one corner of johnston street and richmond quay on the opposite corner stood the golden age hotel and it was the first in the series of hotels stores and houses which went to sea though not exactly the house which gave the evil example the beginning of the disaster in fact was at the remote end of the town and from that end upwards building after building reeled and fell as the water undermined the foundations or beat upon the walls of these buildings the majority made a straight course for sea with all their contents except their living inmates who made hasty escapes others were carried landward in the direction of the head of the lagoon and two of their number occupy sites on the camp reserve while a third that of mr dale is deposited completely converted in arney street one house only of the whole block was left and with it the flood performed the freak of turning it completely round on its foundations so thorough was the sweep of the river frontage at this part of the town thatnothing now intervenes between the riverbank and strike and blackmore brewery and that establishment now forms as important a feature in the architectural aspect of the town as it does in the list of local industries perhaps the most extraordinary scene of wreck and ruin was that presented in arney street and especially alongside the camp reserve the buildings which had stood in the front street were simply conspicuous by their absence but their contents and the contents of some scores of other buildings were much more conspicuous by their presence and distribution in a state of the most admired disorder alongside the court-house fence here were furniture and fixings of all sorts mixed in the most extraordinary manner in such a manner as to require almost the art of a conjuror to select from the mass any two articles belonging to one house but among the heap of stuff the evicted owners of domiciles were diligently searching for something or other which they never appeared to find and possibly never would find beyond this scene of wreck there was another further seaward a shingle beach where all the sheets of galvanised iron had congregated as in one common cemetery in many other parts of the town cemeteries of some kind or another are discoverable and if a census were taken of all the dogs cats and poultry which have been done unto death by the flood it would no doiibt form some serious reading for the humane members of the community humanity and benevolence we may here say have had ample exercise during and since the flood neighbours assisted neighbours to their utmost and the liberality of the leading hotelkeepers was as noticeable as it was necessary no sooner was locomotion possible than a number of ladies also undertook the task of collecting subscriptions for the relief of immediate wants and no doubt their benevolent object will recommend itself to all who are not themselves sufferers and who are in a position to afford assistance to those who have suffered most by the disaster and these are many one of the excursionists from wanganui who in the steamer of the same name lately visited dunedin has published an account of his trip in the herald we extract the following passage the maori prisoners were

brought them many visitors and the gentlemen of the white tiehave been very warm in their sympathies with their cannibal friends indeed thes same brown-skinned gentlemen have raised up supporters all over dunedin whohave not failed to condole with them on their hard lot now the only result i can see of this ill-advised conduct will be that when our parental government release the natives according to promise they will return to their kaingas with a feeling of revenge rankling at their hearts and who can be surprised if they take the first opportunity of again joining in any fresh outbreak they are well employed in dunedin which place they have done much for and it is only just they should remain there for the present", "telegrams united press association wellington march 29 the new zealand

in fresh water the celebrated eoquefort cheese made in the village of that name in the aveyron is obtained with a mixture of sheep and goats milk but even in the milking there is a secret for when the udder appears to yield no more the maid strikes it repeatedly with the back of her hnd whereby a little more milk is obtained much richer in butter this operation which is utterly harmless causes the udders to increase in size in course of time the next reason is assigned for the peculiar flavour of roquefort cheese ia that when made into cakes it is kept in caverns hollowed out in a calcareous

or tliree miles into the air which buried hundreds of square miles under rocks sand and mud winch darkened the heavens for hours with volcanic dual which demolished the famous terraces and lett its permanent mark in a vast rift in ihe earth nine miles m length was a stupendous event in its physical and dynamic eiiecls its detonations weie heard along the eat coast and fur out to sea and fiom the wairarapi valley to the waikato the night of terror at the wurou village where the english tourist bainbndge and several of the ilasaanl family perished has been ividly recorded also the destruction of the neighbouring maori settlement with nearly all ts inhabitants the deathroll of that night so far as it could be compiled stood at about one hundred and fom nearly all natives and is believed to be approximately coirect but had the disaster uccmred in a populous district the joss of life might have been such as to rank high among the historic calamities of its class besides wairoa several very small native settlements in the neighbourhood were overwhelmed and completely obliterated and in one of these under live feet of sand one day last week eighteen human skeletons were found it would seem as if all tho inhabitants had taken refuge in the principal house which was strongly enough built to sustain the tremendous pressure of the falling sand and rock under which most of the wairoa dwellings completely collapsed this was of doubtful advantage to those within as instead of being speedily crushed or suffocated they were condemned to a lingering death in the daikness only two appeared to have been killed by fulling objects and these were children whose bones wore in the embraco of an adult skeleton the remains were not disturbed but reverently re-entombed the cataclysm

yesterday ppst the chief jubtka ujpji tioned that the south island climate was more conducive to hardihood dhhn the more genial air of the north is-land in his opinion the transplanted stock of great britain was improving out here especially m the soithern island it is well enough known that new zealand natuially is pioducing a special typa of britain moie lcgy more wiry than the prototype biit the inhabitants have not pondered much about the differences of physique between the new enezations of the two islands la accordance with the cold hard fnets of physiology tinio must establish special dir-timruisbiug traits between individuals bom and hied at the bluff and those nurtured at auckland but there hashardly been suihcient opportunity for the hands oi time to fashion very noticeable new patterns for a series of years carcely closed yet auckland pioduced footballers too stalwart joi the warriors ot the colder clime in the south and generally the football of the noith island during the pa-t decade has been better than the football of the south not by a prepondeianco ot superhuman sublety in the north but lather by a display of greater aeiaie vigour in the individual plvyeis 1 ins is not quoted a an argument against sir robert rerrark but meiely as evidence of the fact that changes in the physique of a country are very gradual one influence to counteract differentiation between the people of the two islands is the migratory habit much of the population is on the move probably the majorilv of new zealand families hae had at least two places of residence with many miles between them involving a change ox climate but as time goes on the tendency of population to become more tied to locality increases in the generations to come the auckland face may be something pirked at a glance when it peepb iulu chiitcliurrh or dunedin in his buoyant manner no doubt supported on solid to gain another columns of fig million ures mr j 5 wilson president of the farmers union anticipated that the valu f e of new zealand export of dairy produce will be soon increased by another million pounds sterling per year if the hon t mackenzie plans are promptly put into practice and the minister has piomised that the scheme recently approved by cabinet published in the post yesterday will ba begun at once mr mackenzie is acting on revised ideas that were promulgated some years ago it is many a day since it was widely recognised that the fountain somce of the butter-fat needed closer supervision some tw years back mr mnab outlined procedure designed to improve the genera 1 average quality of manufactures from milk by ensuring a betterment in the raw material and mr mackenzie line of conduct is to be an amendment of mr mnab s the new line is to go sraightcj to the weak points in the system or supply to the factories the ministei urn is to touch the spot to get as far as the defective cow and the thoughtless dairyman and effect reforms in both by reasonable methods in olden times there was a tendency to allow imperfections to develop and then have inspectors appointed to detect them the new idea is to expand the scope of the instructional work and thus reduce and possibly abolish the need for in spectors it is well that the minister hns said at once for a commencement of this much-required regime the undue proportion of moisture in some of new zealand exported butter has done much harm in this country chief market london the complaints have been many and vigorous but if the depart menl policy proves as good as the minister words the evil of the overdose oi vatpr should soon be removed the country can do with that extra million the lecture on monday night by professor t marshall of earthquake otago university dealt fallacies with certain current misconceptions that are difficult to remove particularly the deepseated fallacy oitcn found in popular books of science that refers earthquakes to pent-up volcanic energy it is of course a fact tliat one ot the symptoms of an eruption is the occurrence of eai lli-tremors in the neighbourhood oi the disturbance but it is demonstrated that the greater seismic phenomen the earthquakes that transmit vibrations to all parts of the carth arise from wholly independent causes in our own islands as the professor showed the seismic and volcanic fields are distinrt and well defined and about as far apart as possible the seismograph has thiown much light on the phenomena of earthquakes which are shown to be caused nut by internal heat but by strains and stresses in the earth crust which sometimes come to breaking-point along certain definite lines of fault there are frequent slippings and more or less violent readjustments of the strata such as may be traced on sea and liver cliffs by the inclination of the surfaces in the present state of science there is no possible means of forecasting earthquakes either as to locality date or seventy no means tyists of measurin ilia strength of strata the stresses to which they ae subject or aiy of the thousand and o 10 conditions which may hasten or retard the shock it is a probable theory that the attraction of the nearer heavenly bodies which is now known to raise a daily tide in the earth cmst as well as in the ocean may in certain conditions bring the ordinary strain to the culminating point and it is a fascinating exercise to predict shocks on this basis but even if the general theory be sound it must be uncertain in the application a forecast can nol be said to be fulfilled if an earthquake occurs say in spain at the hour one was predicted for new zealand some years ago we had among us a man w r ho professed to have intimations of earthquakes in advance by supernatural rcyeuuion and he printed pamphlets giving numerous examples of alleged fulfilments but as the prolessor pointed out with an earth-shaking shock as lecorded by the seismograph about twice a month the predictor whether on the basis of a scientific method or from occult practices will alwajs be able to point to fulfil ments", "when the flood burst the scene in clive tuesday telegraph clive i in a terrible slate last evening at aboht eight oclock it was noticed by one or two residents that the tuki tuki river which is about a mile and a-half away from the township had commenced to overflow the water was just coming over the bank but of course nothiug whatever was thought of it people went to bed at the usual hour and slept in fancied security at twelve oclock there was not a single drep of water about the township but half an hour later there was a terrific roar a bang and a crash clive was flooded the tuki tuki had broken out near the bridge had rushed through the maori ploughed paddock and came over at a great rate to clive the exact location of the outbreak was between tuki tuki bridge the maori pah and matahiwi the residents of east and west clive at first did not recognise their danger or the great calamity that had fallen on them gradually it began to rhe the people hasily dressed but before they had done so the water was up to their beds as it continued to rise rapidly it waa apparent to all that an effort must be mad to save the people lives then there was a terrible scene of excitement a scene which beggars description men yelled bawled and coo-eed for assistance women screamed in their fright and terrified children cried in mortal agony hundreds of cows swam about the township bellowing furiously horses neighed pigs screamed fowls cackled and the noise made resembled appeals to be saved like those from dying men or beasts then there was the howling wind and fearful din nade by the rushing waters which now held possession of the township and rushed pellmell taking everything with them into the ngaruroro river which is crossed by the bridge which approaches clive the people absolutely went frantic could nothing be done to save them where were the boata they yelled knowing all the time that ther were no boata in the locality the men abolutely took their guns and sent chargts of bullets powder and shot through the ceilings of their houses in order that they could cry for help through the holes or if the worsfc came to the worst that they could get out on their house tops and stay there all night in the wind and rain until assistance of some kind arrived a few did get out on their housetops because they were in real danger but there were others who did so who really had no occasion to they being on higher ground but under such circumstance people will do anything especially at night time when any danger threaten the farndon people went across to the ngaruroro bridge but they were absolutely helpless to render any assistance whatever there were no boats handy bo they bad to stand by and look at all the atock about the country and eterything portable in the village float by at a terrible pace constable kennedy happens to lire jii��t across the brtrtgj v the highat section

at v oclock on a similar errand some houses were on higher ground khan others but agonised parents had to stand by all night aud watch their goods floating about their houses in dire confusion and to raise their children to a higher elevation as the water roae it was a terrible night and will neverbe forgotten as long as those who live at clive remain in existence one man had to get out at the gable end of his house aud numerous other instances could be recorded that occurred during the night when daylight made its appearance of course people knew what they were doing and things were not so bad people were all night endeavoring to gt their stock on dry land there was a consilorahle amount of dimoulty about this as the cattle were frantic ami did not know what they were doing there was a terrible lot of water on tho low lying land and a great many cows and sheep wore drowned now as to the assistance rendered from napier pilot kraeft came out in a special train with his staff and life-boat accompanied by superintendent lucas of the spit fire brigade and one or two other firemen they were dropped down at waitangi as the train could go no further and had to come on to clive the best way they could four other big boats also came out from napier but instead of taking the inside route they went round papakura way some where and at tho time of writing had not arrived at the scene of devastation they having taken the wrong route will no doubt prove useful in another direction the boaui are pulled about with great difficulty owing to the swiftness of the tide one got stove against a fence there is from five to eight feet of water about tho place but at the flour mill there is from nine to ten feet horsemen can of course only venture fifty yards from the bridge there is great danger in going any further the people in the hotel over the bridge are imprisoned upstairs all those rescued in the boat were taken to mr smith hotel at farndon where they were fed and given old clothes blankets etc the house is nearly full of humanity and wet clothes there was no meat in the place and two young men rode over against the tide to nelson butcher shop and after great difficulty managed to obtain some mutton for the hotel which was hanging up in the shop for hungry people to eat when one comes to contemplate what this visitation means to the people in a small way of business in clive it is a sorrowful thing asked this morning what was the amount of damage done approximately by the flood so far an old resident said in a most pathetic voice every man in clive

very smart and able man and has succeeded in inspiring marked confidence on the part of city men this is a long step toward success several trials have now been made of the sand pump on the timaru harbour board new dredge and while they have proved that the machine is an efficient lift they have also proved that the solid matter lifted will not settle in the hopper or tank the material is too fine grained and remains in suspension long enough to be all carried out with the water the pump has not yet been tried on pure shingle nor have the grab-dredges been tried on the mud it has been suggested says the lyttelton times that the timaru and otago boards should exchange dredges for a few months as it is believed that the otago bucket dredge would do better work in the timaru silt and the pump better work in the otago sand bar the experiment tried at ashburton a race meeting without a publican booth will probably be described writes the lyttelton times by those prohibitionists who are not insensible to the attractions of the turf as a great success there was a large attendance the largest seen on the course for several years plenty of speculation upon the totalisator and the greatest good order these results probably came as a surprise to the promoters of the meeting who told the local licensing committee a few days ago that the absence of a publican booth would entain financial disaster but they will we are sure be gratified by the proof that the national sport is not indissolubly wedded to whisky our contemporary goes on to say it would be scarcely safe perhaps to form a conclusion on the result of a single experiment but we are certainly encouraged by the experience of the ashburton racing club to hope that the discontinuance of temporary licenses at outdoor gatherings will not occasion any serious inconvenience to the public much feeling has been aroused in the wairarapa of late by the sight of women tramping the country with swags on their backs like

mair mr c h mills mhr who is at present in wellington says the post is bringing under the notice of government the desirableness of encouraging settlers near the seaside to go in for oyster culture by allowing them to lease portions of the foreshore at a nominal rental he points out that many parts of the pelorus sound are admirably adapted for the cultivation of oysters and he is firmly convinced that with a little encouragement numbers of settlers would embark in the industry oyster culture has proved a decided success infrance and mr mills believes that if the new zealand government were to assist in tbe direction he has indicated the colony would in a few years possess a most valuable industry replying to an oamaru deputation the hon j mckenzie said that his interviewers might think that oamaru was the worst place in new zealand but he assured them that there was great distress all over and especially in the towns along the coast from dunedin to christchurch and he heard the same story and the same cry in timaru and in christchurch he did not think the large estate owners were sacking their hands to harass the government cropping was not paying and that was more likely to be the reason and these men were not going to put in any crops consequently they did not want men that is the whole fact in a nutshell news has been received at invercargill of the missing prospectors of

two men and finally to conclude that count dmitry tolstoi the bosom friend of the czar the real ruler of all the russias the incarnation of autocracy centralism and cruelty is one and the same man with count lyof tolstoi the large-hearted liberal-minded poet novelist and friend of the people that the best-bated man in russia the man who has carried out if he did not suggest the policy of reaction and retrogression of the last 10 years who introduced the territile administrative exile who has practically abolished all freedom of the press higher education and district local government the zt-instro the man whom btepniak justly calls the scourge cf russia should be confounded with the tender-hearted lover of his fellow men the man of whom matthew arnold has said his work in religion as well as his work in imaginative literature is more than sufficient to signalise him as one of the mo3t marking interesting and sympathyinspiring men of our time an honour i must add to russia is an insult under vhich the many admirers of the noveliat can hardly be ejf pected to keep silence the death of count lyof tolstoi would have been deeply mourned from one end of russia to the other the death of count dmitry tolstoi is a relief to the nation of the extent of which we can hardly form any idea for it is highly improbable that his successor will prove to be equally able foresighfcedcool unscrupulous and pitiless already the people have shown their joynot by bonfires as they would have done in happier countries but by bombs if the czar should live long enough and should have sufficient good sense to attend the funeral of counb lyof tolstoi he need be in no fear on that day of being scattered to tho four winds of heaven by dynamite or nitroglycerine the queen birthday was of course observed as a general holiday the only places of business kept open in the city being the hotels refreshment roomsfrnifcerera and tobacconists in the morning there was queen weather jn the accepted senwof tfie tar maudto wards the evening holiday weather as it is known as a matter of experience the cbange beiug attributable no doubt to the firing of the volunteers few in the morning could have thought it probable that the day would end in rain and fog with a low thermometer but such was the case during the greater part of the day however the weather was fine and a great number of people left the city for the racecourse the beach and elsewhere at 10 oclock in the morning the rifle volunteers fired a feu de jok and the b battery of artillery under captain proudfootj gave the royal salute of 21 guns the volunteers then left by train for their field drill at abbotaford the traffic on the tramways was heavy but not unusually so for a holiday and the railway traffic was hardly so good as it has been on similar occasions according to their custom the soldiers of the salvation army made a field day of it and for a considerable time were parading the streets or playing and exhorting in the v vicinity of cargill monument and they had also 6pecial services in the fortress the dunedin jockey club autumn meeting was opened yesterday under favourable conditions and will be continued to-day an unfortunate accident occurred in the hurdle race mr pelham jones the owner and rider of monteagle being very seriously iujured by the falling of the horse mr jones was removed

of north branch about six miles from milton was burned down owing to some clothes which were hanging in the kitchen taking fire the furniture was insured in the new zealand office for 50 and the building for 100 in the same office mrs mortimer estimates her loss at 60 over the insurance further mail news has been received says an english newspaper of march 29 concerning the oondition of the irish emigrants in the argentine republic mr patrick cole of buenos ayres writes it was truly a sad and pitiable sight to see irish mothers with in some cases their dying babes in their arms stretched on the ground outside the hotel where they had passed the previous night without any covering as they could not get to the luggage and also to hear strong men amid their tears cursing the evil hour in which they broke up in many cases hanpy homes to como to what they were led to believer was an el dorado hesaysofemigrants generally some of them died of starvation in the lazar house of rosario which are little wooden huts that wore thrown up for the victims of the last cholera epidemic while in many cases mothers sold their clothing from their backs to procure food for their starving children the advocates of marriage with a deceased wife sister scored a victory in the house of commons on april jj when the bill to legalise such marriages in scotland passed its second reading by a majority of 53 the numbers being 184 to 131 the division was therefore taken in a tolerably full housp the opponents of the measure says the correspondent of the sydney morning herald who had been very energetic sought to gain the assistance of the irish nationalists by representing that the pop strongly disapproved of it but this stratagem had precisely the oppo site effect to what was hoped for the rule of the irish nationalist roman catholics is no politics from rome and they voted for mr elliot bill just to show that they had no intention of entrusting their political consciences to the keeping of the vatican there is a disagreement amongst the supporters of the english bill some of whom desire to see its provisions extended so as to embrace marriage with a deceased husband brother the deceased wife sister bill is the oldest in parliament and has eight times passed the house of commons by large majorities mr john douglas final report upon new guinea dated october 31 1888 has recently been published by the colonial office in it he places on record his opinions in regard to the applications he had received during his tenure of offioe from persons who desire to embark in schemes for the settlement of the country or who think that their services as explorers entitled them to reward with regard to the application pub in by captain h c everill on behalf of influential english capitalists mr douglan states that as there are great stretches of country on the fly river unoccupied by the natives and as there is no chance of improvement in this portion of british new guinea unless inducements are offered to people prepared to go there and risk their health lives and money in opening up the watershed of the fly or the aird mr douglas sees no reason why the attempt should nob be made and the light of commerce and civilisation let in upon the deep darkness of savagery now overhanging the region meanwhile mr douglas declares that the immediate value of british new guinea lies in the strategical advantage which the possession of the magnificent natural harbours from hall sound to pitt bay secure to australia we have received from the editor mr william freeman the table of contents of the first number of zealandia which is to be published on july 1 mr s t sharpley opens the magazine with a 1 rondo entitled bon voyage and amongst other features of a varied and attractive programme we notice a skit entitled an old man kangaroo by mr t bracken a complete btory by mr w p reeves mhr an article on social questions by the rev rutherford waddell wanderings in lakeland by mr filalcolm ross and out in the open by mr o m thomson fls two girls each 18 years of age were brought before the city police on the 23rd inst and charged with drunkenness sergeant-major tßevin stated that one of the eirls came from invercargill and the other from south dunedin they were often knocking about town and the previous night they were so drunk that they bad to be arrested mr carew who occupied the bench in addressing the aooaaed said itis a great pity that you are too old to be sent to the industrial school or some place of that sort as this is your first offence there will be no punishment this time but if you are brought up again you must expect to get punished if you come before me i wjll n try if the severest punishment i can give will do you any good it is a terrible thing for girls of your age to be brought up before me on a charge like this i hope you will try and get situations and get over this terrible life it will bring you ta utter ruin if you go on as you are doing the accused did not appear to be much impressed with the gravity of these remarks but simply treated their appearance before the court as a joke and left the dock laughing those who argue that marriage is a failure will find much to confirm their belief in the experience of a board of poor law guardians near london it has always been thecustom co separate the inmates of the unions keeping 1 the men in one department and the women in another some sympathetic soulurged that it wasvposltively cnielto-tnas separata agedcouples who had lived together all their lives and contended that provision should be made by which these unfortunate people might not be deprived of the society of each other the guardians consented at last to make the change in the regulations which required considerable change also in the arrangement of the buildings a number of apartments were finally provided for the married jsouples and when all was ready the old people were apprised of what had been done singularly enough however they all de clined the privilege with a single exception and that couple would not accept the room except on the distinct understanding that it was an experiment and if they were not satisfied they should be allowed to again live separately a claimant to the dukedom of buckingham has turned up in christchurch we recently published an extract from the letter of the correspondent of the argus stating that the dukedom had become extinct it is certain that the late duke though married twice left no male issue but only three daughters ladies anne mary and caroline jemima elizabeth the christchurch press learns that a claimant to the dukedom has arisen in christchurch and that all papers said to be requisite to establish the heirship are by this time in the hands of a lon i don solicitor a younger brother of the claimant having had them in his possession for some 10 years with a view to the present contingency it is expected that the next mail or so from england will bring information confirmatory of the claim dr richard j gatling of hartford the inventor of the famous gun one of which was recently shown in operation at st clair has recently invented a torpedo boat for harbour defence dr gatling says i think that i have solved the problem of harbour defence by torpedo boats i have invented a boat which is certain in its action and which is controlled wholly by the intelligence of operators in it it has exceedingly high speed it is so constructed that its crew are almost wholly protected from the eaemy fire the boat cannot be destroyed or sunk without great difficulty the old automatic torpedoes have never been successful they are erratic in their course after they leave the hands of the operators are deflected by currents seaweed c and hardly ever reach the points at which they are aimed but on the other hand the present form of spar torpedo boats is dangerouß to the crew i think i have got over these difficulties my boat too is inexpensive four of them oan be built for 20000 until the patents are out dr gatling does not care to t describe the bot further mr valentine mhr is evidently no friend of the exhibition replying to a question at his gore meeting he said he did nob approve of the government promising 10000 towards the cost of the new zealand exhibition which was simply a commercial venture made by a limited liability company if the government gave 10000 to the duuediu exhibition company he would ask for 10000 for a gore exhibition company against mr valentine opinion may be placed that of an invercargill business man mr tucker who at a recent meeting of the chamber of commerce said he was prepared to assist all he could and also to put his hand in his pocket in order that it should be a success some had taken exception to the sum 10000 voted by government towards the exhibition but he thought they would have been justified in voting double that amount the argument against it wad that it would benefit dunedin he thought that it would be a vast benefit to the colony and not to dunedin alone atticusin the leader refers as follows to some of the land boom victims

the liquidation would accept 100 for the lot there are a good many gohn bungs in collins street just now the ravensbourne school committee have passed the following motions with reference to school prizes that in the opinion of this committee prizes should be discontinued for the following reasons among others 1 that they suggest motives such as ought sot to influence children in the prosecution of their studies 2 that they are in the nature of the case usually awarded to pupijs of superior natural gifts and not so frequently to those who everything considered may have been most diligent and made most relative progress 3 that they frequently cause unpleasant jealousies and rivalries and tend to discourage pupils of inferior gifts who are thus led to feel that they make failure in their education because unsuccessful in the prize competitions 4 that it would be preferable to expend the moneys hitherto used as prize funds in picnics or excursion trips or in buch a manner that all the pupils may be encouraged and benefited thereby some interesting experiments were made on the 23rd on the wellington-manawatu railway with the electric lighting of the carriages on a plan arranged by mr fulton the locomotive engineer each carriage has a dozen incandescent lamps of five-candle power placed at equal distances in a row along the roof the lamps are worked by an accumulator which had been previously charged with electricity from the dynamo the one accumulajbor charged was found to store sufficient electricity to work the lamps for 15 hours the working of the system is not yet quite perfected but it pro mises to be a revolution in railway carriage lighting it is a great improvement on any plan previously tried there being a far superior 1 diffusion and distribution of light while the extra weight of the accumulation ia not excessive a deal of excitement was occasioned at the 1 tongue wharf on sunday morning when a man named james johnston a resident pf timaru who was in an intoxicated state fell between the steamer centennial and the wharf into the water a rush was at once made for the spot and a rope was lowered but it was sometime before the man realised that he was expected to hold on to the rope like grim death until he was safe on the wharf at last asuspioion of this dawned on his dimmed faculties he grasped the rope and willing hands soon pulled him to a place of safety when a constable took him in charge and escorted him clear of the crowd ten patients were admitted into the dunedin hospital during the week and 22 were discharged william moully hnry

place between mr fleming coroner at baiclutha and the government with reference to the number of fires believed to have been caused by the careless use of matches and their manipulation by rats mr fleming has submitted various suggestions with a view to reducing the risk of fires from the causes mentioned these are under the consideration of the government and it is probable that some

the grand march was led off by captain russell followed by some 40 couples the music was first-class whilst the catering in the hands of mr mkellop was all that was to be desired the hall was nicely decorated with flags and evergreens whilst the uniforms of the officers and volunteers lent variety to the dresses of the ladies dancing was continued with spirit till the early hours of the morning a correspondent at tokanu taupo writes to the new zealand herald two gentlemen who left here for ruanui mr studholme run and returned on the ist inst state that it was reported to them that a startling phenomenon had occurred in the whangaehu river which is of a milky colour very strongly impregnated with sulphur and quite shallow this river which takes its source from the eastern side oi ruapehu and empties itself between wanganui and turakina usually so quiet suddenly iburst forth on the 22nd april from the mountain and in 10 minutes time became a swollen raging torrent bank-high and of inky blackness there had been no rain to cause such a flood and which came solely from its source the mountain there has been no such outbreak previously in the memory of natives or europeans who live near its locality and it is a source of wonder and amazement to them possibly the cessation of steam from the hot lake on the top of ruapehu reported a short time since may have had something to do with it who can tell here is a nut for scientists or hectorites to crack if they can mr j e grace who happened to be mustering sheep on the kaimanawa range which is opposite to ruapehu on the above date states that he saw an immense column of steam ascending high in the air which lasted for about half an hour and then disappeared he thought it at the time most extraordinary as he bad lived in the district a great many years and never saw such a sight before rabbiters in the awatere and surrounding districts says the marlborough press are now we are informed earning at the rate of 1 per day but

and disastrous termination britton claimed the fight on a foul but the referee disallowed the claim this incensed britton supporters and backers who broke into the ring and began a desperate contest with the friends of scott the fight was long and fierce the combatants soon abandoning fists for firearms one of the seconds was fatally wounded by a revolver shot and several other persons were injured by bullets the police being informed of what was going on hastened to the place and made many arrests a truly horrible crime has been perpetrated at sziil hungary a small winegrower found his stock diminishing and hid himself in the cellar to discover the thieves he saw six tramps enter the premises and after copious libations they prepared to take a cask away with them at this juncture he came out of his hiding place and attempted to remonstrate with them they seized him however put him under the wine press and crushed him to death a man who happened to look in to see what was going on was forced by the six wretches to drink the victim blood which was presented to him as wine eventually he managed to slip out and bolting the cellar door ran off for assistance to the neighbouring village the authors of this heinous crime were capture in a state of helpless intoxioafcion byron lady love in love labour lostj can remarks the pall mall gazette no longer claim to be the only mortal born to make black fair for a german medical man has just done the same thing in the literal senie of the word it appears that a short time ago a negro underwent a surgical operation at leipsic after which it became necessary to put 6everal small portions of skin over the wound the skin was taken from two white persons and as the wound began to heal the fair colour of these pieces of skin began to change and when the cure was completed had assumed the ebony colour of the negro body in order to find out whether black skin could in the same manner be changed into fair a small portion of the skin

woman many wonderful things amongst others that he should not ontlive his 46th birthday it is stated that all her other forecasts have been realised one after another greatly to the disquietude of

much enjoyment to his friends on the platform there is some probability of trade being opened up between japan and australia following on the recent visit of the japanese commissioners comes an emissary in the interests of tlie japanese merchants in the person of mr murdoch late of the brisbane grammar school who has been in japan for the best part of last year he is now on a flying visit to brisbane and has been commissioned to report on the lines of japanese produce likely to suit australian tastes he is also engaged in making arrangements at this bnd for a guide service through japan now being established there according to the paris correspondent of the sydney morning herald general boulanger made his escape from paris in disguise assumed in the house of one of his numerous lady friends and accompanied by rocheforfy the only one of his partisans taken by him into his confidence this resort to secrecy in regard to his leading partisans has so thoroughly displeased them that several of those most deeply implicated in his doings have publicly in the chamber and out of it renounced both him and his works the astonishmentcreated by this flighty may be measured by the fact that until the publication of the brussels manifesto the public absolutely refused to believe that the coming saviour of the republic had deserted his friends and his post and loudly declared that the seeming disappearance of their favourite was a trick he was playing off upon the government as a poisson davril the french equivalent of the anglo-saxon april fool the national society organised by boulanger and his friends dissolved itself and public opinion is rapidly arriving at the conviction that the flight of boulanger has destroyed his chance of success and made of boulangism a thing of the past the valuable suggestion made by mr billinghurst before the london institute of bankers that colonial governments in their financial contracts should reserve to themselves the option of a term of years for the repayment of loans has been adopted by the tasmanian government canada and some other colonies for whom as the manager of the london and westminster bank mr billinghurst has acted have protected themselves in this way but it is the first occasion on which an australian government has taken advantageof such a provision the practice has been to borrow money 1 repayable at fixed dates ranging from 25 to 50 years the recent 1000000 tasmanian loan was made payable in 1940 with the right of redemption at parin 1920 or any year thereafter until 1940 if the credit of the colony shall have improved the government of the time may in 1920 redeem the loan and borrowagain at a lower rate but if at that time any great war or other disturbance should have re duced the price of colonial securities the government will have the privilege of putting off the repayment for any following year until 1940 from the board of trade returns it appears there has been a decline of late years in the proportion borne by the irish emigration to the total of the united kingdom this has been going steadily since 1880 when the proportion was as high as 41 per cent in 1887 it was 28 per cent in 1888 it fell further to 26 per cent scotch emigration has been rising in 1885 and for many yearis before its proportion to the total per cent was but small in 1886 it rose to 11 per cent in 1887 to 12 and in 1888 to 13 the destinations of emigrants have not varied much the united states take about 70 per cent of the whole number british north america takes 13 per cent australasia 11 per cent leaving 6 par cent to be divided among the other countries of the world these figures show a slight falling off in the emigration to the united states and to australasia and an increase in that to british north america and to other places this last change is explained as probably due to the recent gold discoveries in the transvaal some maliciously-disposed persons placed a pair of trolley wheels on the railway line at upper port chalmers on sunday last and allowed them to run down the line the railway department offer a reward of 5 for such information as will lead to a conviction a
